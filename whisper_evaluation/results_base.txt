1688-142285-0000	 There's iron they say in all our blood, and a grain or two perhaps is good, but here's he makes me harshly feel, has got a little too much of steel. And on.
1688-142285-0001	 Margaret said Mr. Hale, as he returned from showing his guests downstairs. I could not help watching your face with some anxiety, when Mr. Thornton made his confession of having been a shopboy.
1688-142285-0002	 You don't mean that you thought me so silly?
1688-142285-0003	 I really like that account of himself, better than anything else he said.
1688-142285-0004	 His statement of having been a shopboy was the thing I like best of all.
1688-142285-0005	 You who were always accusing people of being choppy at Helstyn.
1688-142285-0006	 I don't think Mr. Hale, you have done quite right in introducing such a person to us without telling us what he had been.
1688-142285-0007	 I really was very much afraid of showing him how much shocked I was at some parts of what he said.
1688-142285-0008	 His father dying in miserable circumstances.
1688-142285-0009	 Why, it might have been in the workhouse.
1688-142285-0010	 His father speculated wildly, failed, and then killed himself because he could not bear the disgrace.
1688-142285-0011	 All his former friends shrunk from the disclosures that had to be made of his dishonest gambling, wild, hopeless struggles made with other people's money to regain his own moderate portion of wealth.
1688-142285-0012	 No one came forward to help the mother and this boy.
1688-142285-0013	 At least no friend came forward immediately, and Miss Thornton is not one I fancy, to wait till Tady Kyrness comes to find her out.
1688-142285-0014	 Dus daar lift Milton.
1688-142285-0015	 How tainted, asked of other.
1688-142285-0016	 Opa-pa, by that testing everything by the standard of wealth.
1688-142285-0017	 When he spoke of the mechanical powers, he evidently looked upon them only as new ways of extending trade and making money.
1688-142285-0018	 and the poor men around him. They were poor because they were vicious, out of the pale of his sympathies because they had not his iron nature, and the capabilities that it gives him for being rich.
1688-142285-0019	 Not vicious, he never said that.
1688-142285-0020	 In Provident and self-indulgent were his words.
1688-142285-0021	 Margaret was collecting her mother's working materials and preparing to go to bed.
1688-142285-0022	 Just as she was leaving the room, she hesitated. She was inclined to make an acknowledgement which she thought would please her father, but which, to be full and true, must include a little annoyance.
1688-142285-0023	 However, out it came.
1688-142285-0024	 Papa, I do think Mr Thornton a very remarkable man, but personally, I don't like him at all.
1688-142285-0025	 And I do said her father laughing.
1688-142285-0026	 Personally, as you call it, and all.
1688-142285-0027	 I don't set him up for a hero or anything of that kind.
1688-142285-0028	 But good night, child.
1688-142285-0029	 There were several other signs of something wrong about Mrs. Hale.
1688-142285-0030	 She and Dixon held mysterious consultations in a bedroom, from which Dixon would come out crying in cross, as was a custom when any distress of her mistress called up on her symptoms
1688-142285-0031	 Once Margaret had gone into the chamber soon after Dixim lifted and found her mother on her knees, and as Margaret stole out, she caught a few words which were evidently a prayer for strength and patience to induce severe bodily suffering.
1688-142285-0032	 but those she received caresses and fond words back again. In such profusion, as would have gladden her formally, yet she felt that there was a secret withheld from her, and she believed it bore serious reference to her mother's health.
1688-142285-0033	 She lay awake very long this night, planning how to lessen the evil influence of their Milton life on her mother.
1688-142285-0034	 A servant to give Dixon permanent resistance should be got if she gave up the whole time to the search. And then, at any rate, her mother might have all the personal attention she required, and had been accustomed to her whole life.
1688-142285-0035	 visiting register offices, seeing all manner of unlikely people, and very few in the least likely, absorbed Margaret's time and thoughts for several days.
1688-142285-0036	 One afternoon, she met busy higgins in the street and stopped to speak to her.
1688-142285-0037	 Well, Bissy, how are you?
1688-142285-0038	 Better and not better if you know what that means.
1688-142285-0039	 Not exactly replied Margaret smiling.
1688-142285-0040	 I'm better and not being torn to pieces by coughing on nights, but I'm weary and tired of Milton, and longing to get away to the land of Bula. And when I think I'm farther and further off, my heart sinks, and I'm no better, I'm worse.
1688-142285-0041	 Margaret turned around to walk alongside of the girl in her feeble progress
1688-142285-0042	 But for a minute or two she did not speak.
1688-142285-0043	 At last, she's said in a low voice.
1688-142285-0044	 Bessie, do you wish to die?
1688-142285-0045	 Bessie was silent in her turn for a minute or two. Then she replied.
1688-142285-0046	 Not worse than many others are reckoned.
1688-142285-0047	 But what was it?
1688-142285-0048	 You know, I'm a stranger here, so perhaps I'm not so quick at understanding what you mean, as if I'd lived all my life in Milton.
1688-142285-0049	 I had forgotten what I said for the time continued Margaret quietly.
1688-142285-0050	 I should have thought of it again when I was less busy. May I go with you now?
1688-142285-0051	 The sharpness in her eye turned to a whisper longing as she met Margaret's soft and friendly gaze.
1688-142285-0052	 As they turned up into a small court opening out into a squalid street, Bessie said.
1688-142285-0053	 You'll not be daunted if fathers at home and speak some bit gruffish at first.
1688-142285-0054	 but Nicholas was not at home when they entered.
1688-142285-0055	 Gaspeci at last.
1688-142285-0056	 Busy took a long and feverish draft and then fell back and shot her eyes.
1688-142285-0057	 Margaret bent over and said, Bessie, don't be impatient with your life, whatever it is, or may have been.
1688-142285-0058	 Remember who gave it to you and made what it is.
1688-142285-0059	 Now, I'll not have my wench preached too.
1688-142285-0060	 But surely, Sin Margaret facing round. You believe in what I said that God gave her life and ordered what kind of life it was to be?
1688-142285-0061	 I believe what I see, a normal.
1688-142285-0062	 That's what I believe, young woman.
1688-142285-0063	 I don't believe all I hear. No, not by big deal.
1688-142285-0064	 But who's come at last and who's welcome as long as he'll keep from preaching on what who knows not about?
1688-142285-0065	 It's simple and not far to fetch nor hard to work.
1688-142285-0066	 But the girl and you played it the more was Margaret.
1688-142285-0067	 Don't think hardly on him. He's a good man he is.
1688-142285-0068	 I sometimes think I shall be moped with sorrow, even in the city of God, if Father is not there.
1688-142285-0069	 The feverish collar came into her cheeks and the feverish flame into her eye.
1688-142285-0070	 But you'll be there father, you shall. Oh my heart.
1688-142285-0071	 She put her hand to it and became ghastly pale.
1688-142285-0072	 Margaret held her in her arms and put the weary head to rest upon her bosom.
1688-142285-0073	 Presently the spasm that foreshadowed death had passed away, and busy roused the self and said.
1688-142285-0074	 I'll go to bed. It's best place, but catching that Margaret's gun, you'll come again. I know you will. But just say it.
1688-142285-0075	 I'll come tomorrow, St Margaret.
1688-142285-0076	 Margaret went away very sad and thoughtful.
1688-142285-0077	 She was late for tea at home.
1688-142285-0078	 Have you met with a servant, dear?
1688-142285-0079	 No, Mama, that Ann Buckley would never have done.
1688-142285-0080	 Sposor Try said Mr. Hell.
1688-142285-0081	 Everybody else has had their turn at this great difficulty. Now, let me try.
1688-142285-0082	 I may be the Cinderella to put on the slipper after all.
1688-142285-0083	 What would you do, Papar? How would you say to Baton?
1688-142285-0084	 Well, I would apply it to some good house mother to recommend me one known to herself or her servants.
1688-142285-0085	 Very good but we must first catch our house mother.
1688-142285-0086	 The mother of whom he spoke to us said malgrap.
1688-142285-0087	 Mr. Thornton, the only mother he has, I believe, said Mr. Hale quietly.
1688-142285-0088	 I shall like to see her. She must be an uncommon person. Her mother added.
1688-142285-0089	 Perhaps she might have a relation who might suit us and be glad of our place.
1688-142285-0090	 She sounded to be such a careful, economical person that I should like anyone out of the same family.
1688-142285-0091	 My dear, said Mr. Hill, alarmed. I don't go off on that idea.
1688-142285-0092	 I'm sure at any rate, she would not like strangers to know anything about it.
1688-142285-0093	 Take notice that this is not my kind of fortiness papar if I have any at all, which I don't agree to, so you're always accusing me of it.
1688-142285-0094	 I don't know positively that it is hers either, but from little things I've gathered from him, I fancy so.
1688-142285-0095	 They cared too little to ask in what manner her son had spoken about her.
1998-15444-0000	 If Carl to a case supposed a suspecter to be one of poisoning, the medical man has two duties to perform. To save the patient's life and to place himself in a position to give evidence of Carl to do so.
1998-15444-0001	 He should make inquiries as to symptoms and time at which fruit or medicine must last taken.
1998-15444-0002	 He should notice the position and temperature of the body, the condition of rigour mortis, marks of violence, appearance of lips and mouth.
1998-15444-0003	 In making a postmodum examination, the elementary canal should be removed and preserved for further investigation.
1998-15444-0004	 The gut and the gut being cut across between these ligatures, the stomach may be removed entire without spilling its contents.
1998-15444-0005	 If the medical practitioners endowed on any point, he should obtain technical assistance from someone who has paid attention to the subject.
1998-15444-0006	 In a case of attempted suicide by poisoning, is it the duty of the doctor to inform the police?
1998-15444-0007	 The best dramatic is that which is at hand.
1998-15444-0008	 The days for an adult is 10 minutes.
1998-15444-0009	 Epomorphine is not allied in physiological action to morphine and may be given in cases of narcotic poisoning.
1998-15444-0010	 Ticking the faucets with a feather makeside vomiting.
1998-15444-0011	 In using the elastic stomach tube, some fluids should be introduced into the stomach before attempting to empty it, or a portion of the mucus membrane may be sucked into the aperture.
1998-15444-0012	 The tube should be examined to see that it is not broken or cracked, as accidents have happened from neglecting this precaution.
1998-15444-0013	 Antidotes are usually given hyperdermically or if they're mouth in the form of tablets.
1998-15444-0014	 In the absence of the hypodermic syringe, the remedy may be given by the rectum.
1998-15444-0015	 Notice the small, color and general appearance of the matters submitted for examination.
1998-15444-0016	 For the separation of an alkaloid, the following is the process of Stas Auto.
1998-15444-0017	 This process is based upon the principle that the souls of the acolytes are soluble in alkaline water and insoluble in ether.
1998-15444-0018	 The pure alkaloids with the exception of morphine in its crystalline form are soluble in ether.
1998-15444-0019	 2. Cool the mixed-gent filter. Watch the weathered you with strong alcohol and mix the photos well.
1998-15444-0020	 The weathered you may be set aside for the detection of the metallic poisons of suspected. Prepare the alcohol but careful evaporation.
1998-15444-0021	 On the evaporation of the alcohol, the resinous and fatty matter separate.
1998-15444-0022	 I've applied the filtrate to a cyrup and extract with successive portions of absolute alcohol.
1998-15444-0023	 Separate the ethereal solution and evaporate.
1998-15444-0024	 5. A part of this ethereal solution is poured into a watch glass and allowed to evaporate.
1998-15444-0025	 To purify it add a smock quantity of dilute syphilic acid and after evaporating to 3-4 of its bulk add a saturated solution of carbonate of pot ash or soda.
1998-15444-0026	 Boil the finely divided substance with about 1-8 its bulk of pure hydrochloric acid. Add from time to time, potassium chloride, until the solids are reduced to a straw yellow fluid.
1998-15444-0027	 The residue of the material after digestion was hydrochloric acid and potassium chloride may have to be examined for silver, lead and barium.
1998-29454-0000	 A thousand blessings from a great for heart.
1998-29454-0001	 Perusal said the pawnbroker, that's the way to pronounce it.
1998-29454-0002	 His books told him the treasure is best hidden in the loose boards, and as of course, your house has a secret panel, which his had not.
1998-29454-0003	 He got it up and pushed his treasures as far in as he could, along the rough, crumbly surface of the last implaster.
1998-29454-0004	 Wendelke came down, his aunt slightly slapped him, and he took the half-pony and limped off obediently.
1998-29454-0005	 He had never seen one before and it interested him extremely.
1998-29454-0006	 He looked about him and knew that he did not at all know where he was.
1998-29454-0007	 What's up, matey? Lost your way? Dickie explained.
1998-29454-0008	 When he said, have I been asleep?
1998-29454-0009	 and we ask that them in.
1998-29454-0010	 Not exactly, said the man, but it's alright.
1998-29454-0011	 When it was over, the men asked Tiki if he could walk a little way, and when Tiki said he could, they set out in the most friendly way side by side.
1998-29454-0012	 and the T and all, and the egg.
1998-29454-0013	 and this is the prettiest place ever I see.
1998-29454-0014	 I should catch it if I treat as it is.
1998-29454-0015	 She was waiting for the water boy, the kettle when it come out. Mother.
1998-29454-0016	 and bad when she's in a good temper.
1998-29454-0017	 that then but you'll be in when you get back.
1998-29454-0018	 I got a stick it said Dickie sadly, I'd best be getting home.
1998-29454-0019	 I wouldn't get home not if I was used at the man.
1998-29454-0020	 No, Satuki. Oh, no. No, I never.
1998-29454-0021	 aia da tia, hai, hai, hai, hai, hai, hai, hai, hai, hai.
1998-29454-0022	 Well, they'll show you the sort of man I am.
1998-29454-0023	 The men's men are so kind and tidy, the whole adventure is so wonderful and new. Is it country where you're going?
1998-29454-0024	 The sand shot long golden beams through the gaps in the head.
1998-29454-0025	 A bird passed in its flight on a branch quite close and clung their swing.
1998-29454-0026	 He took out of his pocket and your envelope a new sheet of paper and a new pencil ready sharpened by machinery
1998-29454-0027	 and I ask you, let me come along with you. Got that?
1998-29454-0028	 Cut as well down then done.
1998-29454-0029	 Then he folded it and put it in his pocket.
1998-29454-0030	 Now is square, he said.
1998-29454-0031	 They could put a man away for less than that.
1998-29454-0032	 I see that they are in a book, so I take it sound.
1998-29454-0033	 He reward the wake the last of the English and I want to know what it's up for.
1998-29454-0034	 White once and a half size L.E.
1998-29454-0035	 Adventures, I should think so.
1998-29454-0036	 Ah, satt diggie, Ende Vollzeilensfalle between dem.
1998-29454-0037	 That was charming, but it was pleasant too to rush the matter of on the wet grounds.
1998-29454-0038	 Licky always remembers that moment.
1998-29454-0039	 So you shall, said Mr. Beer, a regular wash all over this very night. I always like to wash myself.
1998-29454-0040	 Some those think it pays to be dirty, but it don't.
1998-29454-0041	 If you're clean they say, on this poverty, and if you're dirty they say, serve you right.
1998-29454-0042	 You are good, Setic here, I do like you.
1998-29454-0043	 I know you will, Sarticchi, was in thro' the asm. I know how good you are.
1998-29454-0044	 Bless me, said Mr. Beard, uncomfortably. Well there.
1998-29454-0045	 Step out, Sunny, or you never get there this side of Christmas.
1998-29454-0046	 Well, you know all about it presently.
1998-29455-0000	 The singing and laughing went on long after he had fallen asleep, and if, later in the evening, there were loud voice arguments or a crubble's even, Dickie did not hear them.
1998-29455-0001	 What's on that there, Dicky-Aast? Pointing to the odd, knobbly bundles of all swords and shapes tied onto the paramilater's front.
1998-29455-0002	 Tell you what mate, looks to me as if I took a fancy to you.
1998-29455-0003	 Swap me, he said helplessly.
1998-29455-0004	 Or look, the diggy, the flowers.
1998-29455-0005	 They're only wreath said beer.
1998-29455-0006	 But I shall have them while they are live, Setici, as you'd said to the pond broker about the moonflowers.
1998-29455-0007	 Hi, there goes the rabbit.

1998-29455-0009	 How beautiful Satyuki, wriggling was delight.
1998-29455-0010	 This life of the rabbit, as described by Mr. Beal, was the child's first glimpse of freedom. I'd like to be a rabbit.
1998-29455-0011	 How might a wee of the room in Pram if you go sound like us if you was a back of fields?
1998-29455-0012	 I like you next to my own daddy and Mr. Backstaff next door.
1998-29455-0013	 That's a right, said Mr. Bill awkwardly.
1998-29455-0014	 Dickey quick to imitate, touch this.
1998-29455-0015	 Poor little man, that's the lady, you must your mother, don't you?
1998-29455-0016	 A well-downed little once had Mr. Butu himself.
1998-29455-0017	 The two travelers were left facing each other, the rich are by Penny and O, wonderful good fortune, a whole half-crown.
1998-29455-0018	 No, I never said to you, yes, the steable.

1998-29455-0020	 They went on up the hill, as happy as anyone need wish to be.
1998-29455-0021	 Please do not be too shocked.
1998-29455-0022	 Remember that neither of them knew any better.
1998-29455-0023	 to the other tramp, lies and packing when that drum means of livelihood.
1998-29455-0024	 But you said the bet was the green curtains at the key.
1998-29455-0025	 Which this end, not by no means.
1998-29455-0026	 The night is full of interesting little sounds that will not at first let you sleep. The rustle of little white things in the hatches, the barking of dogs and distant farms, the chirp of crickets and the quirking frogs.
1998-29455-0027	 The new game of begging and inventing stories to interest the people from movement was worse wild to beg, but on galley, day by day and week by week, and diggy by constant practice, grew so clever taking his part in the acting that Mr. B. was quite dazed with admiration.
1998-29455-0028	 Blessed if I ever see such a nipper, he said, over and over again.
1998-29455-0029	 Clever the train dog ears in all outer zone at.
1998-29455-0030	 I am sure as I addn't better stick to the road and keep away from out ends like you Jim.
1998-29455-0031	 I hope he is clever enough to do what he stole. Keep his mug shut, that's all.
1998-29455-0032	 If you straight you do for me and the end I do for him, see?
1998-29455-0033	 See that bloke just now, sir, Mr. Beer? Yes, sir, Diggie.
1998-29455-0034	 Well, you'll never see him.
1998-29455-0035	 If anyone asks you if you ever see him, you never said eyes on him in all your bones. Not to remember him.
1998-29455-0036	 Dickie was full of questions, but Mr. B. had no answers for them.
1998-29455-0037	 No, was it Sunday, on which they took a rest and washed their shirts, according to Mr. Beale's rule of life.
1998-29455-0038	 They did not stay there, but walked out across the dunes, with the skydocks were singing, and on a dip of the dunes came upon great stone wards and towers very strong and gray.

2609-157645-0007	 One Sunday, says Mr. Ditzfield, he ended that trip pipe, in Chantra, the clerk, told him that the people were getting impatient.
2609-157645-0008	 Then I'm seeing another song, take the curate.
2609-157645-0009	 They have served with Panty Clark.
2609-157645-0010	 Then let them sing the hundred and nineteen. I'll find the curate.
2609-157645-0011	 Six arms, the nurse within reach, presented with an obedient start and as many tobacco piled up to the man of offers.
2609-157645-0012	 David Dean's hammer did not at all prove this irreverence
2609-157645-0013	 Going to church at Hays and Thursdays missed and been quite in the signing experience.
2609-157645-0014	 When these men and the courts of my Roman struts found out that was not going to continue the castle, they no longer cared to be minicants.
2609-169640-0000	 Perox in that quarter were usually distrusted by the subset is true, but the CS4 with him, far more are innocent than on guilty of any acts of violence.
2609-169640-0001	 Now we're on after the sunset, the wind fell to an light air. That just kept the steered trail in the ship.
2609-169640-0002	 Fortunately, the John was not only fat, but it reminded her harem as the light-footed girl turns into the lively dance.
2609-169640-0003	 and never was in a better steering soup, mostly spetry and moderate weather.
2609-169640-0004	 Mr. Marble, he ought to believe, was fairly snoozing on the hinkoops, being like the sailors, as one might say, periously.
2609-169640-0005	 At that moment, I had a noise, when familiar to Seaman, that of an ore falling in the boat.
2609-169640-0006	 I think it. Sell whole and close the board.
2609-169640-0007	 He was trimmings of the semen to require a second look in order to assert him but was to be done.
2609-169640-0008	 Although they went three feet to R2, this gave us a moment of breathing time.
2609-169640-0009	 As our seats were offline forward and remained so for a few minutes, it gave me a little to talk about.
2609-169640-0010	 As soon as our both procs in gliding up was added to perceive that they had not approached materially near.
2609-169640-0011	 Miss Akai deserves its awesome remark. That our movements had been so prompt as to take the rascals back.
2609-169640-0012	 A breath fits stillness to seed it.
2609-169640-0013	 The Prolettes did not enter the course, but near the horse fast.
2609-169640-0014	 I heard the rattling of the boarding parts too, as they were cut adrift from the spanker boom and fell upon the decks.
2609-169640-0015	 Kite went out and returned with three or four baskets and there's many pipes.
2609-169640-0016	 The stillness that Rangongoopsides was like that of death.
2609-169640-0017	 The giant behave beautifully, he came round like a top.
2609-169640-0018	 The question was now whether we could pass them or not before they got nearing up to Grandpa.
2609-169640-0019	 The captain behave perfectly well in its critical incident, commanding a dead silence in the closest incident to his orders.
2609-169640-0020	 Now I'm so aboard the John Wizard.
2609-169640-0021	 On our side we gave the gentleman the four sixes to enter the nearest and to enter the Stern-Mutt's Prova, which was still near Kebos-Leinth-Thirson.
2609-169640-0022	 They were like the yells of fiends and anguettes.
2609-169640-0023	 I don't, if we touched and manned in the near its prey.
2609-169640-0024	 In that state, the ship huts ahead, all of her canvas been full, leaving the pro-emotion rich and her wake.
3005-163389-0000	 They swarmed up in front of Sherburn's palings as thick as they could jam together, and you couldn't hear yourself think for the noise.
3005-163389-0001	 Some sung out, tear down the fence, tear down the fence.
3005-163389-0002	 The stillness was awful, creepy and uncomfortable.
3005-163389-0003	 Sherbin run his eyes slow along the crowd and wherever it struck the people tried a little to outgaze them but they couldn't. They dropped their eyes and looked sneaky.
3005-163389-0004	 The average man's a coward.
3005-163389-0005	 Because they're afraid the man's friends will shoot them in the back in the dark, and it's just what they would do.
3005-163389-0006	 So, they always equip, and then a man goes in the night with a hundred masked cowards at his back and l inches the rascal.
3005-163389-0007	 You didn't want to come.
3005-163389-0008	 but a mob without any man at the head of it is beneath pitifulness.
3005-163389-0009	 Now leave and take your half a man with you Tulsa he is gunna up across his left arm and cocking it when he says this
3005-163389-0010	 The crowd washed back sudden and then broke all apart and went tearing off every which way and buck hearted us. He healed it after them looking tolerable cheap.
3005-163389-0011	 You can't be too careful.
3005-163389-0012	 They argued and tried to keep him out, but he wouldn't listen and the whole show would come to what his fans do.
3005-163389-0013	 and one or two women begin to scream.
3005-163389-0014	 So then the ringmaster, he made a little speech and said he hoped there wouldn't be no disturbance, and if the man would promise he wouldn't make no more trouble, he would let him ride if he thought he could stay on the horse.
3005-163389-0015	 It weren't funny to me though, I was all of a tremble to see his danger.
3005-163389-0016	 and the horse is going like a house of fire too.
3005-163389-0017	 He shed them so thick they kind of clogged up the air and all together he shed 17 suits
3005-163389-0018	 Why, it was one of his own men.
3005-163390-0000	 and but never mind the rest of his outfit. It was just wild, but it was awful funny.
3005-163390-0001	 The people most killed themselves, laughing, and when the king got done capering and capered off behind the scenes They roared and clapped and stormed and ha ha till he come back and done it over again and after that They made him do it another time
3005-163390-0002	 20 people sings out.
3005-163390-0003	 The Duke says yes.
3005-163390-0004	 Everybody sings out. Sold!
3005-163390-0005	 But a big fine looking man jumps up on a bench and shouts. Hold on.
3005-163390-0006	 Just a word gentlemen, they stop to listen.
3005-163390-0007	 What we want is to go out of here quiet and talk to show up and sell the rest of the town
3005-163390-0008	 You made it is the judge is right everybody sings out.
3005-163390-0009	 We struck the raft at the same time, and in less than two seconds we was gliding downstream, all dark and still, and edging towards the middle of the river. Nobody saying a word.
3005-163390-0010	 We never showed a light till we was about 10 miles below the village.
3005-163390-0011	 Green horns, flat heads.
3005-163390-0012	 No, I say it don't.
3005-163390-0013	 Well, it don't, because it's in the breathe. I reckon they're all alive.
3005-163390-0014	 Well, that's what I'm saying. All kings is mostly rapscays, as far as I can make out. Is that so?
3005-163390-0015	 and look at Charles II and Lewis XIV and Lewis XV and James II and Edward II and Richard III and Forty-more besides all them sacks and heptarkes that used to rip around so in old times and raise
3005-163390-0016	 My, you ought to see an old Henry the Eighth when he was in bloom. He was a blossom.
3005-163390-0017	 Ring up Fair Roseman.
3005-163390-0018	 Well, Henry, he takes a notion he wants to get up some trouble with this country.
3005-163390-0019	 Suppose he opened his mouth, what then?
3005-163390-0020	 All I say is kings is kings and you got to make allowances.
3005-163390-0021	 Take them all around their almighty honorary life. It's the way they're raised.
3005-163390-0022	 Well, they all do, Jim.
3005-163390-0023	 Now, to do, he's a tolerable like the man in some ways.
3005-163390-0024	 This one's a middling hard lot for a Duke.
3005-163390-0025	 When I wake up just a daybreak, he was sitting there with his head down to twist his knees Morning and morning to himself
3005-163390-0026	 It don't seem natural, but I reckon it's so.
3005-163390-0027	 He was often moaning in morning and at way nights when he judged I was asleep and saying Polo little Elizabeth
3005-163390-0028	 Don't you hear me? Shut that door.
3005-163390-0029	 I lay I make you mine.
3005-163390-0030	 Just as loud as I could yell.
3005-163391-0000	 which was sound enough judgment, but you take the average man and he wouldn't wait for him to howl.
3005-163391-0001	 The King's Duds was all black and he did look real swell and starchy.
3005-163391-0002	 Why, before he looked like the ordinary old rip that ever was. But now, when he'd take off his new white beaver and make a bow and do a smile, he looked that grand and good and pious that you'd say he'd walked right out of the ark, and maybe was old Leviticus himself.
3005-163391-0003	 Jim cleaned up the canoe and I got my paddle ready.
3005-163391-0004	 Where are you bound for a young man?
3005-163391-0005	 Get aboard says the king
3005-163391-0006	 I'd done so and then we all three started on again.
3005-163391-0007	 The young chap was mighty thankful. City was tough work tooting his baggage such weather.
3005-163391-0008	 He asked the king where he was going and the king told him he'd come down the river and landed at the other village this morning. And now he was going up a few miles to see an old friend on a farm up there. The young fellow says,
3005-163391-0009	 But then I said again, no, I reckon it ain't him, or else he wouldn't be paddling up the river. You ain't him, are you?
3005-163391-0010	 No, my name is Blodget, Alexander Blodget. Reverend Alexander Blodget, I suppose I must say, is I'm one of the large poor servants.
3005-163391-0011	 You see, he was pretty old, and George's guillurals was too young to be much company for him, except Mary Jane, the red-headed one. And so he was kinder loansome after George and his wife died and didn't seem to care much to live.
3005-163391-0012	 Too bad, too bad he couldn't have lived to see his brothers poor soul.
3005-163391-0013	 I'm going in a ship next Wednesday for Rio Genero where my uncle is.
3005-163391-0014	 But it'll be lovely. Wish I was a going.
3005-163391-0015	 Mary Jane's 19, Susan's 15, and Joanna's about 14. That's the one that gives herself to good works and has a hair lift. Poor things.
3005-163391-0016	 Well, they could be worse off.
3005-163391-0017	 Oh Peter had friends and they ain't gonna let them come to know harm.
3005-163391-0018	 Blame defeat didn't acquire about everybody and everything in that blessed town and all about the Wilksons and about Peter's business Which was a Tanner and about George's which was a carpenter and about Harvest which was a Decentering Minister and so on and so on Then he says
3005-163391-0019	 When they're deep, they won't stop for a hail.
3005-163391-0020	 Was Peter Wilkes well off?
3005-163391-0021	 When we struck the boat she was about done loading and pretty soon she got off.
3005-163391-0022	 Now, hustle back right off and fetch the duke up here and the new carpet bags.
3005-163391-0023	 So then they waited for a steamboat.
3005-163391-0024	 But the king was calm. He says.
3005-163391-0025	 They give a glance at one another and nodded their heads as much as to say what to tell you
3005-163391-0026	 Then one of them says, kind of soft in general.
3005-163399-0000	 Phelps is one of these little one-horse cotton plantations, and they all look alike.
3005-163399-0001	 I went around and climbed over the backstop by the ash hopper and started for the kitchen.
3005-163399-0002	 out with a yes and for a thought.
3005-163399-0003	 So then she started for the house leading me by the hand and the children tagging after.
3005-163399-0004	 When we got there she set me down in a split-bottom chair and set herself down on a little low stool in front of me holding both of my hands and says,
3005-163399-0005	 Well, it's lucky, because sometimes people do get hurt.
3005-163399-0006	 and I think he died afterwards. He was a Baptist.
3005-163399-0007	 Yes, it was mortification, that was it.
3005-163399-0008	 Your uncle's been up to the town every day to fetch you.
3005-163399-0009	 You must have met him on the road, didn't you? Oldish man with a...
3005-163399-0010	 Why child it'll be stole
3005-163399-0011	 It was kind of thin ice, but I says.
3005-163399-0012	 I had my mind on the children all the time. I wanted to get them out to one side and pump them a little and find out who I was.
3005-163399-0013	 Pretty soon she made the cold chill streak all down my back because she says
3005-163399-0014	 I see it warrant a bit of use to try to go ahead. I'd got to throw up my hand.
3005-163399-0015	 So I says to myself, here's another place where I got to rest the truth.
3005-163399-0016	 I opened my mouth to begin, but she grabbed me and hustled me in behind the bed and says, here it comes!
3005-163399-0017	 Children, don't you say a word.
3005-163399-0018	 I see I was in a fix now.
3005-163399-0019	 Mrs. Phelps, she jumps for him and says
3005-163399-0020	 Has he come? No, says her husband.
3005-163399-0021	 I can't imagine it says the old gentleman, and I must say it makes me dreadful uneasy.
3005-163399-0022	 Well, and easy, she says. I'm ready to go distracted.
3005-163399-0023	 He must have come and you've missed him along the road.
3005-163399-0024	 Oh, don't distress me anymore, I'm already distressed.
3005-163399-0025	 Why, Silas, look yonder, up the road. Hate that somebody coming?
3005-163399-0026	 The old gentleman stared and says,
3005-163399-0027	 I ain't no idea who is it.
3005-163399-0028	 It's time for your...
3005-163399-0029	 Being Tom Sawyer was easy and comfortable and it stayed easy and comfortable till by and by I hear a steamboat coughing along down the river.
3005-163399-0030	 then I says to myself, Sposedime Sora comes down on that boat.
3080-5032-0000	 But, I am hugely pleased that you have seen my lady.
3080-5032-0001	 I knew you could not choose but like her, but yet let me tell you you have seen but the worst of her.
3080-5032-0002	 Her conversation has more charms and can be in mere beauty and a humor and disposition would make a deformed person appear lovely.
3080-5032-0003	 Why didn't you not send me that news? And a garland?
3080-5032-0004	 Well, the best on it is that I have a squire now that is as good as a knight.
3080-5032-0005	 In earnest, we have had such a skirmish and upon so foolish an occasion as I cannot tell which is strangers.
3080-5032-0006	 All the people that I had ever and my life refused were brought again upon the stage, like Richard III's ghosts, to approach me with all. And all the kindness his discoveries could make I had for you was lead to my charge.
3080-5032-0007	 My best qualities, if I have any that are good, served but for aggravation of my fault, and I was allowed to have wit and understanding and discretion in other things that it might appear I had none in this.
3080-5032-0008	 It's a strange change and I'm very sorry for it, but I'll swear I know not how to help it.
3080-5032-0009	 Mr. Fish is a squire of dames, and has so many mistresses that anybody may pretend to share in him and be relieved. Though I have the honour to be his near neighbour, to speak freely, I cannot brag much that he makes any court to me, and I know no young woman in the country that he does not visit often.
3080-5032-0010	 I think my youngest brother comes down with him.
3080-5032-0011	 I can no sooner give you some little hints where about they live, but you know them presently. And I meant you should be beholding to me for your acquaintance.
3080-5032-0012	 But it seems this gentleman is not so easy access. But you may acknowledge something due to me, if I inclined him to look graciously upon you and therefore there is not much harm done.
3080-5032-0013	 I have missed four fits and I've had but five and have recovered so much strength as made me venture to meet your letter on Wednesday, a mile from home.
3080-5032-0014	 But, besides, I can give you others.
3080-5032-0015	 I am here much more out of people's way than in town, where my aunt and such has pretended and interested me, and a power over me, do so persecute me with their good nature. And take it so ill that they are not accepted as I would, live in a hollow tree to avoid them.
3080-5032-0016	 You will think him altered and if it be possible more melancholy than he was.
3080-5032-0017	 If marriage agrees no better with other people than it does with him, I shall pray that all my friends may escape it.
3080-5032-0018	 Well, in earnest, if I were a prince, that lady should be my mistress. But I can give no rule to anyone else, and perhaps those that are no danger of losing their hearts to her, maybe infinitely taken with one, I should not value at all. For Sosa's or Justinian, wise providence has ordained it that by their different humans, everybody might find something to please themselves with them, without envy
3080-5032-0019	 The matter is not great. For I confess, I do naturally hate the noise and talk of the world. And should be best pleased never to be known in upon any occasion whatsoever. Yet, since it can never be wholly avoided, one must satisfy oneself by doing nothing that one needs care. And should be best pleased never to be known in upon any occasion whatsoever.
3080-5032-0020	 If I had a picture that would fit for you, you should have it.
3080-5032-0021	 How can you talk of defying fortune? Nobody lives without it. And therefore why should you imagine you could?
3080-5032-0022	 I know not how my brother comes to be so well informed as you say, but I am certain he knows yet most of the injuries you have received from her.
3080-5032-0023	 We have had another debate, but much more calmly.
3080-5032-0024	 And besides, there was a time when we ourselves were indifferent to one another. Did I do so then, or have I learned it since?
3080-5032-0025	 I have been studying how Tom Cheek might come by his intelligence and I very to believe he has it from my cousin, Peters.
3080-5032-0026	 How kindly do I take the civilities of your fathers? In earnest, you cannot imagine how his letter please me.
3080-5040-0000	 would it would leave me and then I could believe I shall not always have occasion for it.
3080-5040-0001	 My poor lady, Vavisar, is carried to the tower, and her great belly could not excuse her, because she was acquainted by somebody that there was a plot against the protector, and did not discover it.
3080-5040-0002	 She has told now all that was told her, but vows she will never say from when she had it. We shall see whether her resolutions are as unalterable as those of my lady Talmash.
3080-5040-0003	 I wonder how she behaved herself when she was married.
3080-5040-0004	 I never saw anyone yet that did not look simply and out of countenance. Now, Evan knew a wedding well designed, but one, and that was of two persons, where at time enough I confessed to contrive it, and nobody to please inhibit themselves.
3080-5040-0005	 The truth is, I could not endure to be Mrs. Bride in a public wedding. We made the happiest person on earth.
3080-5040-0006	 do not take it ill, for I would endure it if I could rather than fail. But in earnest, I do not think it were possible for me.
3080-5040-0007	 Yet, in earnest, your father will not find my brother paid in wanting and civility, though he is not a man of much compliment, unless it be in his letters to me. Nor an unreasonable person in anything, so he will allow him out of his kindness to his wife to set a higher value upon her sister than she deserves.
3080-5040-0008	 My aunt told me, no longer a god than yesterday, that I was the most willful woman that ever she knew, and had an obstinacy of spirit nothing could overcome. Take heed.
3080-5040-0009	 You see, I give you fair warning.
3080-5040-0010	 By the next, I shall be going to Kent and my other journey is later side, which I am not the spree that because it would have broken our intercourse very much.
3080-5040-0011	 Here are some verses of qualities. Tell me how you like them.
3080-5040-0012	 I told you in my last that my Suffolk journey was laid aside and that into Kent hastened.
3080-5040-0013	 If I drown by the way, this will be my last letter. And like a will, I bequeath all my kindness to you in it. With a charge, never to bestow it all upon another mistress, my ghost rise again and hunt to you.
3080-5040-0014	 Indeed, I like him extremely, and he is commended to me by people that know him very well, and are able to judge for a most excellent servant and faithful as possible.
3080-5040-0015	 Because you find fault with my other letters, this is like to be shorter than me. I did not intend it so though I can assure you.
3080-5040-0016	 I do not find her. Though I am told I was so extremely when I believed you loved me.
3080-5040-0017	 But I'm called upon.
3080-5040-0018	 Directed for your master.
3080-5040-0019	 I see you can chid when you please. And with authority, but I deserve it, I confess. And all I can say for myself is that my fault proceeded from a very good principle in me.
3080-5040-0020	 We do not let our tongues lie more on one side of our mouth than the other for fear of overturning it.
3080-5040-0021	 You are satisfied I hope, at this that I escape drowning.
3080-5040-0022	 But I am troubled much, you should make so illa journey to so little purpose. Indeed, I read by the first post after my arrival here, and cannot imagine how you came to miss of my letters.
3080-5040-0023	 how welcome you will be. But alas!
3080-5040-0024	 For my life I cannot beat into their heads a passion that must be subject to not a care, an even perfect kindness that must last perpetually without the least intermission.
3080-5040-0025	 They laugh to hear me say that one unkind word would destroy all the satisfaction of my life and that I should expect our kindness should increase every day if it were possible but never lessen.
3080-5040-0026	 We go abroad all day and play all night and say our prayers when we have time.
3080-5040-0027	 While in sober earnest now, I would not live for a twelve month to gain all that King has lost, unless it were to give it him again.
3080-5040-0028	 Will you be so good nature?
3080-5040-0029	 He has one son and sister finest boy that Eryu saw and has a noble spirit but yet stands in that awe of his father that at one word from him is as much as twenty whippings.
3080-5040-0030	 You must give me a leave to entertain yourselves with discourses or the family, for I can tell you nothing else from hence.
3080-5040-0031	 Not to know when you would come home, I can assure you, not for any other occasion of my own, but with a cousin of mine that had long designed to make herself sport with him. He did not miss her for aim.
3080-5040-0032	 In my life, I never heard so ridiculous a discourse as he made us and no old woman who passes for a witch could have been more puzzled to seek what to say, to reason what people than he was.
3080-5040-0033	 Ever since this adventure, I have had so great a belief in all things with this nature that I could not for barely laying a peace card with nine peas into under my door yesterday. It was informed by it that my husband's name should be Thomas. How do you like that?
3331-159605-0000	 She pulled her hair down, turned her skirt back, put her feet on the fender, and took part on her lap. All of which arrangements signified that something very important had got to be thought over and settled.
3331-159605-0001	 The more proposals, the more credit.
3331-159605-0002	 I've tried it, I liked it, and maybe this is the consequence of that night's fun.
3331-159605-0003	 Just to pose it is true that he does ask me and I say yes.
3331-159605-0004	 What a spiteful thing I am!
3331-159605-0005	 I could do so much for all at home how I should enjoy that.
3331-159605-0006	 Let me see how can I begin?
3331-159605-0007	 He has known her all her life and has a good influence over her.
3331-159605-0008	 Now, as Polly was by no means a perfect creature, I am free to confess that the old temptation assailed her more than once that week, for when the first excitement of the dodging reform had subsided, she missed the pleasant little interviews that used to put a certain flavor of romance into her dull, hard-working days.
3331-159605-0009	 I don't think it was his wealth, accomplishments or position that most attracted Polly, though these doubtless possessed the greater influence than she suspected.
3331-159605-0010	 It was that indescribable something which women are quick to see and feel in men who have been blessed, wise and good mothers.
3331-159605-0011	 This had an especially charm to Polly, for she soon found that this side of his character was not shown to everyone.
3331-159605-0012	 Lately, this had changed, especially towards Pali, and it flooded her more than she would confess even to herself.
3331-159605-0013	 At first, she tried to think she could, but unfortunately hearts are so contrary that they won't be obedient to reason, will or even gratitude.
3331-159605-0014	 Polly felt a very cordial friendship for Mr Sidney, but not one particle of the love which is the only coin in which love can be truly paid.
3331-159605-0015	 This finished police in decision, and after that night she never allowed herself to dwell upon the pleasant temptation, which came in a guy's particularly attractive to a young girl, with the spies of the old Eve in her composition.
3331-159605-0016	 When Saturday came, Polly started as usual for a visit to Becky and Bess, but couldn't resist stopping at the shore to leave a little parcel for Fenn, though it was calling time.
3331-159605-0017	 A foolish little speech to make to a dark, but you see, Polly was only a tender-hearted girl, trying to do her duty.
3331-159605-0018	 Take hold of Massachusetts Handmasmaby and walk pretty like William Flossy, said the maid.
3331-159605-0019	 A street corner, a black-eyed schoolboy was parting from a rosy face schoolgirl whose music role he was reluctantly surrendering.
3331-159605-0020	 How he got there was never very clear to Polly, but there he was flushed in a little out of breath, but looking so glad to see her till she had not the heart to be stiff and cool, as she had fully intended to be when they met.
3331-159605-0021	 She really couldn't help it. It was so pleasant to see him again, just when she was feeling so lonely.
3331-159605-0022	 That is the way I get to the Ross, and to the Polly.
3331-159605-0023	 She did not mean to tell, but his friendness was so adorable she forgot herself.
3331-159605-0024	 But I know her better, and I assure you that she doesn't prove. She tries to mend her thoughts, though she won't own it, and will surprise you someday, but the amount of heart and sense and goodness she has got.
3331-159605-0025	 Thank you. No.
3331-159605-0026	 Her lovely the park looks, she said in great confusion.
3331-159605-0027	 Ask the odd fo young man laying a trap into which Polly immediately fell.
3331-159605-0028	 He was quicker to take a hint than she had expected. And being both proud and generous, we saw to settle the matter at once for Polysake as well as his own.
3331-159605-0029	 So, when you met a last boy in Dreamark, he said quietly, watching your face keenly all the while. I thought so, well, I'm going out of town and business for several weeks, so you can enjoy your little bit of country without being annoyed by me. Enhoyed?
3331-159605-0030	 She thought she had a good deal of the coquette in her, and I have no doubt that with time and training she would have become a very dangerous little person, but now she was far too transparent and straightforward by nature, even to tell a wide-like level.
3331-159605-0031	 He was gone before she could do anything but look up at him with a remorse for face and she walked on, feeling that the first imperves the only lover she would ever have had read his answer and accepted it in silence.
3331-159605-0032	 Polly did not return to her favorite walk till she learned from Minnie that Uncle had really left town, and then she found that his friendly company and conversation was what had made the way so pleasant after all.
3331-159605-0033	 Working 2 and 4 as usual, what's the news with you?
3331-159605-0034	 Perhaps he'll kill him.
3331-159605-0035	 utterly done with and laid upon the shelf.
3331-159605-0036	 When he said the other day she wished he was a pigeon, so she could paddle in the paddles and not fuss about rebels.
3331-159605-0037	 Now don't be affected, Polly, but just tell me like a deer has not eaten for post.
3331-159605-0038	 Don't you think he means to?
3331-159605-0039	 Julie, Julie Fan
3331-159605-0040	 I don't mean to be prying, but I really thought he did.
3331-159605-0041	 Well, I always meant to try it if I got a chance, and I have.
3331-159605-0042	 I just gave him a hint and he took it.
3331-159605-0043	 He meant to go away before that, so don't think his heart is broken. Or mind what city Tatlers say.
3331-159605-0044	 He understood and being a gentleman made no fuss.
3331-159605-0045	 But Polly, it would have been a grand thing for you.
3331-159605-0046	 I'm not, you know, I'm prefer to be an independent spinster and teach music all my days.
3331-159609-0000	 Never mind what the business was. Its surfaces to say that it was a good beginning for young men like Tom, who have been born and bred in the most conservative class of the most conceited city in New England, needed just the healthy, hearty social influences of the West to widen his views and make a man of him.
3331-159609-0001	 Fortunately, everyone was so busy with the necessary preparations that there was no time for Romans of any sort, and the four young people worked together so verbally and sensibly, as if all sorts of emotions were not buttered up in their respective hearts.
3331-159609-0002	 Pity that the ancient comes so soon, that the hour did its work and went its way, leaving a clearer atmosphere behind, but the young folks did not see it then, for their eyes with them because of the pardings that must be.
3331-159609-0003	 If it hadn't been for two things, I fear she never would have stood a summer in town, but Sydney often called to her vacation came and the voluminous correspondence with Polly
3331-159609-0004	 Tom wrote once a week to his mother, but the letters were short and not very satisfactory. For men never do tell the interesting little things that women best like to hear.
3331-159609-0005	 Now I'm only tired, had a good deal to do lately, and the dull weather makes me just a travel proof!
3331-159609-0006	 Forgive me, Polly, but I can't help saying it. For it is there, and I want to be as true to you as you were to me if I can.
3331-159609-0007	 I tried not to deceive myself, but it does seem as if there was a chance of happiness for me.
3331-159609-0008	 Thank heaven for that!
3331-159609-0009	 quite poorly with the hardiest satisfaction in her voice.
3331-159609-0010	 Poor Polyv was so taken by surprise that she had not a world to say.
3331-159609-0011	 Non-be-needed, her tellt her face answered for her, as well as the impulse which made her hide her head in the sofa-cushing, I give full-ish ostrich, and the handers are after it.
3331-159609-0012	 one so twice, but sort of jokingly, and I thought it was only some little flotation.
3331-159609-0013	 It was so stupid of me not to guess before.
3331-159609-0014	 It was her tender, earnest and defiant, that Fanny forgot the defense of her own love and admiration of Polly's loyalty to her. For this faithful, all-absorbing love was a new revelation to Fanny, who was used to hearing her friends boast of two or three lovers a year, and calculate their respective values, with almost as much coolness as the young men discussed the fortunes of the girls they wished for, but could not afford to marry.
3331-159609-0015	 I hope Maria Bailey is only things her, she added softly, but I could not bear to have him disappointed again.
3331-159609-0016	 So if I need turning hopeful all at once...
3331-159609-0017	 Suppose I say a word to Tom, just inquire after his heart and a channel away, you know, and give him a chance to tell me if there's anything to tell.
3331-159609-0018	 Beard, people always do bear things somehow, and that poly, looking as if sentence had been passed upon her.
3331-159609-0019	 It was a very different window from the last above the girls.
3331-159609-0020	 If any wanted to show him what she could do toward making a pleasant home, she certainly succeeded by it and she suspected. Funds bite of many failures and discouragements behind the scenes. The little house became a most attractive place to Mr. Sydney at least, for he was more the house friend than ever, and seemed determined to prove that change of fortune made no difference to him.
3331-159609-0021	 She kept much at home when the days work was done, finding it pleasant to do sit dreaming of a book or suing alone, then to exert herself even to go to the shores.
3331-159609-0022	 Polly was not at all like herself that mender, and those nears to her saw in Vandhod at it most.
3331-159609-0023	 Fonad was so absorbed in business that he ignored the whole Bayley question and left them in other darkness.
3331-159609-0024	 Then he came walking in the ponder one day, looking as if she poured hiding of such great joy that she hardly knew how to tell them.
3331-159609-0025	 But if work baskets were gifted with powers of speech, they could tell stories more true in tender than any will read.
3528-168656-0000	 She had even been in society before the Revolution.
3528-168656-0001	 It was her pleasure and her vanity to drag in these names on every pretext.
3528-168656-0002	 Every year she solemnly renewed her vows and at the moment of taking the oath she said to the priest Massin your Saint-François gave it to Massin your Saint Julien Massin your Saint Julien gave it to Massin your Saint-Youcivius Massin your Saint-Youcivius gave it to Massin your Saint Procopius etc. etc.
3528-168656-0003	 And the schoolgirls would begin to laugh, not in their sleeves, but under their veils, charming little stifled laughs, which made the vocal mothers frown.
3528-168656-0004	 It was a century which spoke through her, but it was the 18th century.
3528-168656-0005	 The rule of Fonterville did not forbid this.
3528-168656-0006	 She would not show the subject to anyone.
3528-168656-0007	 That's it for anish to subjective comment for all those who were on occupied or bored in the comment.
3528-168656-0008	 Some unique chocolate, some authentic relic.
3528-168656-0009	 They lost themselves in conjectures.
3528-168656-0010	 When the poor old woman died, they rushed to her cupboard more hastily than was fitting, perhaps, and opened it.
3528-168656-0011	 He is resisting, fluttering his tiny wings, and still making an effort to fly. But the dancers laughing with a satanical air.
3528-168656-0012	 Moral, Love Concert by the Colic.
3528-168669-0000	 The priorist returned and seated herself once more on her chair.
3528-168669-0001	 We will present a stenographic report of the dialogue which then ensued to the best of our ability.
3528-168669-0002	 Father, prevent!
3528-168669-0003	 Reverend Mother, do you know the chapel?
3528-168669-0004	 And you have been in the choir in pursuance of your duties two or three times.
3528-168669-0005	 There is a stone to be raised. Heavy?
3528-168669-0006	 This slab of the pavement, which is at the side of the altar.
3528-168669-0007	 The slab which closes the walls? Yes.
3528-168669-0008	 It would be a good thing to have two men for it.
3528-168669-0009	 The woman is never a man.
3528-168669-0010	 Because Dom Mabelan gives 417 epistles of St. Bernard, while Merlona's Horses only gives 367. I do not despise Merlona's Horses. Neither do I.
3528-168669-0011	 Marriage consists in working according to one's strength. A cloister is not a dockyard.
3528-168669-0012	 And a woman is not a man, but my brother is a strong one though.
3528-168669-0013	 And can you get a lever?
3528-168669-0014	 There is a ring in this stone.
3528-168669-0015	 I will put the lever through it.
3528-168669-0016	 That is good Reverend Brother, I will open the vault.
3528-168669-0017	 Will that be all? No!
3528-168669-0018	 Give me your orders, very reverent bother.
3528-168669-0019	 For that, we have confidence in you.
3528-168669-0020	 I'm here to do anything you wish.
3528-168669-0021	 And to hold your peace about everything. Yes, Robert Mother.
3528-168669-0022	 With the voltage open, I will close it again.
3528-168669-0023	 But before that, watch Reverend Mother.
3528-168669-0024	 Father Fruven, Reverend Mother.
3528-168669-0025	 You know that a mother died this morning?
3528-168669-0026	 No. Did you not hear the bell?
3528-168669-0027	 Nothing can be heard at the bottom of the garden. Really?
3528-168669-0028	 And then the wind is not blowing in my direction this morning.
3528-168669-0029	 It was Mother Crucifixion.
3528-168669-0030	 Three years ago, Madame de Bison, a Janssonist, turned orthodox, merely from having seen Mother Crucifixion at prayer. Ah!
3528-168669-0031	 The mothers have taken her to the dead room, which opens on the church. I know.
3528-168669-0032	 a fine sight it would be to see a man enter the bedroom. More often.
3528-168669-0033	 Hey, more often.
3528-168669-0034	 What do you say?
3528-168669-0035	 I say more often. More often than what?
3528-168669-0036	 Reverend Mother, I did not say more often than what I said more often.
3528-168669-0037	 but I did not say more often.
3528-168669-0038	 At that moment, 9 o'clock struck.
3528-168669-0039	 At 9 o'clock in the morning, and at all hours, praised and adored be the most holy sacrament of the altar. So the priors.
3528-168669-0040	 It cut more often short.
3528-168669-0041	 Fush live out mobbed his forehead.
3528-168669-0042	 In her lifetime, Mother Crucifixion made converts. After her death, she will perform miracles. She will.
3528-168669-0043	 Father Fulvent, the community has been blessed in Mother Chris Fiction.
3528-168669-0044	 She retained her consciousness to the very last moment.
3528-168669-0045	 She gave us her last commands.
3528-168669-0046	 If you had a little more faith, and if you could have been in her cell, she would have cured your leg merely by touching it. She smiled.
3528-168669-0047	 There was something of paradise in that death.
3528-168669-0048	 Foscial about thought that it was an orison which she was finishing.
3528-168669-0049	 Foshalovart held his peace. She went on.
3528-168669-0050	 I have consulted upon this point many ecclesiastics laboring in our Lord who occupy themselves in the exercises of the clear-ocal life and who bear wonderful fruit.
3528-168669-0051	 Fortunately, the priors completely absorbed in her own thoughts did not hear it.
3528-168669-0052	 She continued. Further for ven?
3528-168669-0053	 Yes, Reverend Mother.
3528-168669-0054	 St. Turentius, Bishop of Port, where the mouth of the tyber empties into the sea, requested that on his tomb might be engraved to the sign which was placed on the graves of parasites in the hope that Passersby would spit on his tomb. This was done.
3528-168669-0055	 The dead must be obeyed. So be it.
3528-168669-0056	 For that matter, no, Reverend Mother.
3528-168669-0057	 Further prevent, Mother Crucifixion will be interred in the coffin in which she has slept for the last 20 years. That is just...
3528-168669-0058	 It is a continuation of her slumber.
3528-168669-0059	 So I shall have to nail up that coffin? Yes.
3528-168669-0060	 I am at the orders of the very reverent community.
3528-168669-0061	 The four mother presenters will assist you.
3528-168669-0062	 No, in lowering the coffin.
3528-168669-0063	 Where? Into the vault.
3528-168669-0064	 Fush live on started. The vault entered the altar.
3528-168669-0065	 Under the altar. But...
3528-168669-0066	 You will have an iron bar. Yes, but...
3528-168669-0067	 You will race the stone with the bar by means of the ring. But...
3528-168669-0068	 The dead must be obeyed, to be buried in the vault under the altar of the chapel, not to go to profane earth, to remain there in death where she prayed while living, such was the last wish of Mother Crucifixion.
3528-168669-0069	 She asked it of us, that is to say, commanded us.
3528-168669-0070	 But it is forbidden.
3528-168669-0071	 Oh, I am a stone in your walls.
3528-168669-0072	 Think, Father, for then, if she were to work miracles here.
3528-168669-0073	 What a glory of God for the community, and miracles issue from tombs.
3528-168669-0074	 But Reverend Mother is the agent of the Sanitary Commission.
3528-168669-0075	 But the commissary, please.
3528-168669-0076	 Shono Dimaire, one of the seven German kings who entered among the Gauls under the empire of Constantius, expressly recognized the right of nuns to be buried in religion, that is to say, beneath the altar.
3528-168669-0077	 The world is nothing in the presence of the cross.
3528-168669-0078	 Martin, the 11th General of the Carthusions, gave to his order this device. Stat Kru, Doom, Volvator, Orbis.
3528-168669-0079	 The prioris, who was usually subjected to the barrier of silence, and whose reservoir was over full, rose and exclaimed with the request of a dam which has broken away.
3528-168669-0080	 I have on my right Benoit and on my left Bernard. Who was Bernard?
3528-168669-0081	 The first abbot of Clairvaux.
3528-168669-0082	 His order has produced 40 popes, 200 cardinals, 50 patriarchs, 1600 archbishop, 4600 bishops, 4 emperors, 12 emperors, 46 kings, 41 queens, 3600 canonized saints, and has been in existence for 1400 years.
3528-168669-0083	 On one side St. Bernard, on the other the agent of the sanitary department.
3528-168669-0084	 God subordinated to the chemistry of police, such as the age. Silence for va.
3528-168669-0085	 No endouts the right of the monastery to Sepulcher.
3528-168669-0086	 Only fanatics and those in error deny it.
3528-168669-0087	 We live in times of terrible confusion.
3528-168669-0088	 We are ignorant and impious.
3528-168669-0089	 And then religion is attacked. Why?
3528-168669-0090	 Because there have been bad priests, because Sagittair, Bishop of Gap, was the brother of Salon, Bishop of Embrum, and because both of them followed Mamal.
3528-168669-0091	 They persecute the saints.
3528-168669-0092	 They shut their eyes to the truth. Darkness is the rule.
3528-168669-0093	 The most ferocious beasts are beasts which are blind.
3528-168669-0094	 Oh how wicked people are.
3528-168669-0095	 By order of the king signifies today by order of the revolution
3528-168669-0096	 One no longer knows what is due to the living or the dead. A holy death is prohibited.
3528-168669-0097	 Gutheer, Bishop of Chalon, held his own in this matter against Otho, Duke of Burgundy.
3528-168669-0098	 The priors took breath then turned to Fashlaval.
3528-168669-0099	 You will close the coffin. The sisters will carry it to the chapel.
3528-168669-0100	 The office for the dead will then be set.
3528-168669-0101	 But she will hear. She will not listen.
3528-168669-0102	 Besides, what the Cluster knows the world learns not.
3528-168669-0103	 A pause ensued.
3528-168669-0104	 You will remove your belt.
3528-168669-0105	 Has the doctor for the dead paid his visit?
3528-168669-0106	 He will pay it for a clock today.
3528-168669-0107	 The peel which orders the doctor for the dead to be summoned has already been run.
3528-168669-0108	 But you do not understand any of the pills.
3528-168669-0109	 That is well, Father For Finn.
3528-168669-0110	 Where will you obtain it?
3528-168669-0111	 I have my heap of old iron at the bottom of the garden.
3528-168669-0112	 Reverend Mother, what?
3528-168669-0113	 If you were ever to have any other jobs of this sort, my brother is the strong man for you. A perfect Turk.
3528-168669-0114	 You will do it as speedily as possible.
3528-168669-0115	 I cannot work very fast. I'm in firm. That is why I require an assistant. I limp.
3528-168669-0116	 Everything must have been completed a good quarter of an hour before that.
3528-168669-0117	 I will do anything to prove my zeal towards the community. These are my orders. I am to nail up the coffin.
3528-168669-0118	 At 11 o'clock exactly, I am to be in the chapel.
3528-168669-0119	 Mother Ascension will be there. Tumant would be better.
3528-168669-0120	 However, never mind, I shall have my lever.
3528-168669-0121	 After which, there will be no trace of anything.
3528-168669-0122	 The government will have no suspicion.
3528-168669-0123	 The empty coffin remains. This produced a pass.
3528-168669-0124	 What is to be done with that coffin father present?
3528-168669-0125	 It will be given to the earth. Empty.
3528-168669-0126	 Ahhh... leader Exclamedy
3528-168669-0127	 The wheel stuck fast in his throat.
3528-168669-0128	 He made haste to improvise and expedient to make her forget the oath.
3528-168669-0129	 I will put earth in the coffin, Reverend Mother, that will produce the effect of a corpse.
3528-168669-0130	 I will make that my special business.
3538-142836-0000	 General observations on preserves, confectionery, ices, and dessert dishes.
3538-142836-0001	 The expensive preserving them with sugar is a serious objection for, except the sugar is used in considerable qualities, the success is very uncertain.
3538-142836-0002	 Fruit gathered in wet or foggy weather will soon be melted and be of no service for preserves.
3538-142836-0003	 But, to distinguish these properly requires very great attention and considerable experience.
3538-142836-0004	 If you dip the finger into the serve and apply it to the thumb, the tenacity of the serve will, on separating the finger and thumb, afford a thread, which shortly breaks. This is the little thread.
3538-142836-0005	 Let it boil up again, then take it off and remove carefully the scum that is risen.
3538-142836-0006	 It is considered to be sufficiently boiled when some taken up in a spoon pours out like oil.
3538-142836-0007	 Before sugar was in use, honey was employed to preserve many vegetable productions, though this substance is now given later the juice of the sugar cane.
3538-142836-0008	 1499.
3538-142836-0009	 Boil them up three days successfully, skimming each time, and they will then be finished and in a state fit to be put into pots for use.
3538-142836-0010	 The reason why the fruit is emptied out of the preserving pan into an earthen pan is that the acid of the fruit acts upon the copper, of which the preserving pans are usually made.
3538-142836-0011	 From this example, the process of preserving fruits by syrup would be easily comprehended.
3538-142836-0012	 They should be dried in the stove or oven on a sieve and turned every six or eight hours, fresh powdered sugar being sifted over them every time they're turned.
3538-142836-0013	 and this way it is also that orange and lemon chips are preserved.
3538-142836-0014	 Marmalades, jams and fruit paces of the same nature and are now in very general quest.
3538-142836-0015	 Marlison jams differ little from each other. Their preserves have half-liquid consistency made by boiling the pulp of fruits, and sometimes part of the rinds with sugar.
3538-142836-0016	 that they may keep it as necessary not to be sparing of sugar. 1503.
3538-142836-0017	 And all the operations for preserve making when the preserving pan is used is should not be placed on the fire But on a trivet unless the jam is made on a hot plate when this is not necessary
3538-142836-0018	 Confectionary, 1508.
3538-142836-0019	 In speaking of confectionaries, should be remarked that all the various preparations above named come strictly speaking under that head. For the various fruits, flowers, herbs, and juices, which one boiled with sugar were formally employed in pharmacy, as well as for sweet meats, were called confections, from the Latin word, Confierce, to make up. But the term confectionery embraces a very large class, indeed, of sweet food, many kinds of which should not be attempted in the ordinary cuisine.
3538-142836-0020	 The thousand and one ornamental dishes that adorn the tables of the wealthy should be purchased from the confectioner They cannot profitably be made at home
3538-142836-0021	 However, as late as the reign of our two last Georgia's, fabulous sums were often expended upon fanciful desserts.
3538-142836-0022	 The shape of the dish is very different periods, the prevailing fashion, present being oval and circular dishes on stems.
3538-142836-0023	 the earth, so if you have dark eyes...
3538-142836-0024	 A dessert or at some evening parties, aisys are scarcely to be dispensed with.
3538-142836-0025	 The spattle is generally made of copper, kept bright and clean.
3538-142836-0026	 They should be taken immediately after the repast or some hours after, because the taking of these substances during the process of digestion is apt to provoke indisposition.
3538-163619-0000	 There was once of a time a widower who had a son and a daughter by his first wife.
3538-163619-0001	 From the very day that the new wife came into the house there was no peace for the men's children, and not a corner to be found where they could get any rest. So the boy thought that the best thing he could do was to go out into the world and try to earn his own bread.
3538-163619-0002	 But his sister, who was still at home, fared worse and worse.
3538-163619-0003	 Tis me girl said the head.
3538-163619-0004	 And when the King entered in Salt, he stood still as if he were in fetters and could not stir from the spot for the picture seen to him so beautiful.
3538-163619-0005	 These promise to make all the hasty good and set forth from the King's palace.
3538-163619-0006	 At last, they came inside of land.
3538-163619-0007	 While if my brother says so, I must do it," said the man's daughter, and she flung her casket into the sea.
3538-163619-0008	 What is my brother saying as to sister again?
3538-163619-0009	 On the first Thursday night after this, a beautiful maiden came into the kitchen of the palace and begged the kitchen maid who slept there to let her brush.
3538-163619-0010	 She begged very prettily and got it and then she brushed her hair and the gold dropped from it
3538-163619-0011	 Out on the ugly bushy bride, sleeping so soft by the young king's side, on sand and stones my bad I make, and my brother sleeps with a cold snake, unpeady and unwapped.
3538-163619-0012	 I shall come twice more, and then never again," said she.
3538-163619-0013	 This time also, as before, she borrowed a brush and brushed her hair with it, and the gold dropped down as she did it, and again she sent the dog out three times. And when they dawned, she departed, but as she was going, she said as she had said before, I shall come once more, and then never again.
3538-163619-0014	 No one can tell how delighted the king was to get rid of that hideous bushy bride, and get a queen who was bright and beautiful as day itself.
3538-163622-0000	 Wilk out serve me and watch my seven foes as the king.
3538-163622-0001	 The youth saw that it was very easy work to watch the foals and then he could do it well enough.
3538-163622-0002	 Hasta watched faithfully and well the whole day long said the King when the lad came into his presence in the evening.
3538-163622-0003	 Yes, that I have said to you.
3538-163622-0004	 He had gone out once to seek a place he said, but never would he do such a thing again.
3538-163622-0005	 the King promised him the same punishment and the same reward that he had promised his brother.
3538-163622-0006	 When he had run after the foals for a long, long time and was hot and tired, he passed by a cleft in the rock where an old woman was sitting, spinning with a distaff, and she called to him.
3538-163622-0007	 Come and there come his or my handsome son and let me comb your hair
3538-163622-0008	 The youth liked the thought of this, let the holes rumble they chose, and seated himself in the cluck to the rock by the side of the old hag.
3538-163622-0009	 So there he sat with his head on her lap taking his ease the live long day
3538-163622-0010	 On the third day, Sidler lad wanted the set out.
3538-163622-0011	 The cheap brothers laughed at him and his father and mother begged him not to go, but all to no purpose, and Cinderella had set out on his way.
3538-163622-0012	 I'm walking about in search of a place that's under that.
3538-163622-0013	 I would much rather have the princess that's in the lab.
3538-163622-0014	 and let's take journey downwards along long way.
3538-163622-0015	 When they had gone thus for a long, long way, the full again earth, it dust out see anything now.
3538-163622-0016	 Yes, now I see something that is white so it's in the lab
3538-163622-0017	 It looks like the chunk of a great thick birch tree.
3538-163622-0018	 Sinderlade tried but could not do it so he had to take a draw from the picture and then one more and after that Still another and then he was able to real the sword was perfect ease
3538-163622-0019	 For we are brothers of the princess, whom now or to have, when now can't tell the king what we even drink. But there's a mighty troll who's cast a spell over us.
3538-163622-0020	 When they each have it a long, long way, the fool said, does that see anything?
3538-163622-0021	 and now in quadruple system nothing now
3538-163622-0022	 Now they said the full. Does that not see anything now?
3538-163622-0023	 That is a river said the full and we have to cross it.
3538-163622-0024	 I've done my best replights in the lab.
3538-163624-0000	 Once upon a time there was a king in the north who had won many wars, but now he was old.
3538-163624-0001	 The old king went out and fought bravely, but it last his sword broke and he was wounded and his men fled
3538-163624-0002	 But in the night when the battle was over his young wife came out and searched for him among the slain And it last she found him and asked whether he might be healed
3538-163624-0003	 So, yes, the queen. How do you know in the dark of night whether the hours are wearing to the morning?" And she said,
3538-163624-0004	 Then the old man said, drive all the horses into the river and choose the one that swims across.
3538-163624-0005	 He is no bigger than other dragon said the tutor and if he were as brave as your father, you would not fear him
3538-163624-0006	 Then, the person who had killed Otter went down and caught the dwarf who owned all the treasure and took it from him.
3538-163624-0007	 only one ring was left, which the dwarf wore, and even that was taken from him.
3538-163624-0008	 So, Regan made a sword and Sigurd tried it with a blow on a lump of iron and the sword broke.
3538-163624-0009	 Then Sigurd went to his mother and asked for the broken pieces of his polished blade and gave them to Regan.
3538-163624-0010	 So, cigarettes said that sword would do.
3538-163624-0011	 Then he saw the track which the dragon had made when he went to a cliff to drink. And the track was as if a great river had rolled along and left a deep valley.
3538-163624-0012	 But Sigurd waited till half of him had crawled over the pit, and then he thrust the sword gram right into his very heart.
3538-163624-0013	 Sigurd said, I would touch none of it if by losing it I should never die.
3538-163624-0014	 But all men die and no brave men let's death frighten him from his desire.
3538-163624-0015	 Guy that's Faffner, and then Faffner died.
3538-163624-0016	 Then Sigurd rode back in met Regan and Regan asked him to roast Fafner's heart and let him taste of it.
3538-163624-0017	 so so good put the heart of Fafterner on a stake and roasted it.
3538-163624-0018	 There is Sigurd roasting Fafner's heart for another when he should taste of it himself and learn all wisdom.
3538-163624-0019	 That let him do, then ride over Hinfeld to the place where Bernhild sleeps.
3538-163624-0020	 There must be sleep till the comes for her waking. Rise up and ride for now. Sure she will swear the vow, fearless of breaking.
3538-163624-0021	 Then he took the helmet off the head of the sleeper and behold she was the most beautiful lady
3538-163624-0022	 Then Sigurd rode away and he came to the house of a king who had a fair daughter.
3538-163624-0023	 When Bernhil's father told Gunner that she would marry Nunn but him who could ride the flame in front of her enchanted tower, and that they rode, and Gunner said his horse at the flame but he would not face it.
3538-163624-0024	 For one day, when Bernharden Gundren or Baving, Bernhard waited farthest out into the river and said she did that to show she was Gundren superior.
3538-163624-0025	 For her husband she said had ridden through the flame when no other man dared face it.
3538-163624-0026	 Not long to wait, he said, till the bitter sword stands fast in my heart, and now will not live long when I am dead.
367-130732-0000	 Lobsters and Lobsters
367-130732-0001	 When is a lobster not a lobster? When it is a crayfish?
367-130732-0002	 This question and answer might well go into the primary of information for those who come to San Francisco from the east. For what is called a lobster in San Francisco is not a lobster at all, but a crayfish.
367-130732-0003	 The Pacific crayfish however serves every purpose, and while many contend that its meat is not so delicate and flavor as that of its eastern cousin, the California will astrayalously insist that it is better. But of course, something must always be allowed for the patriotism of the California.
367-130732-0004	 A book could be written about this restaurant, and then all would not be told for all its secrets can never be known.
367-130732-0005	 It was here that most magnificent dinners were arranged. It was here that extraordinary dishes were concocted by chefs of worldwide fame. It was here that lobster alain Newberg reached its highest perfection, and this is the recipe that was followed when it was prepared in the domonigo.
367-130732-0006	 lobster o'la Newberg.
367-130732-0007	 One pound of lobster meat, one teaspoon full of butter, one half pint of cream, Yolks of four eggs, one wine glass of sherry, lobster fat.
367-130732-0008	 Put this in a double boiler and let cook until thick stirring constantly.
367-130732-0009	 Serve in a chafing dish with flint slices of dry toast.
367-130732-0010	 King of Shelfish.
367-130732-0011	 One has to come to San Francisco to partake of the King of Shelfish, the mammoth Pacific Crab.
367-130732-0012	 I say, come to San Francisco, advisedly, for while the crab is found all along the coast it is prepared nowhere so deliciously as in San Francisco.
367-130732-0013	 Gobe's past with the fire, and the little restaurant bearing his name in charge of his widow and Union Square Avenue has not attained the fame of the old place.
367-130732-0014	 It is possible that she knows the secret of preparing Krab as it was prepared in the goby's of before the fire, but his perceived to not descend to her.
367-130732-0015	 Go these crabs do.
367-130732-0016	 Take the meat of one large crab, scraping out all the fat from the shell.
367-130732-0017	 soak the crab meat in the shared 2 hours before cooking.
367-130732-0018	 Chopped finely onion, sweet pepper and tomato with the rosemary.
367-130732-0019	 Heat this in a stew pan and when simmering add the sherry and crab meat and let all cook together with the slow fire for 8 minutes.
367-130732-0020	 Serve in a chafing dish with toasted crackers or thin slices of toasted bread.
367-130732-0021	 Lobster in miniature.
367-130732-0022	 So far it has been used mostly for garnishment of other dishes, and it is only recently that the whole brow has been making a specialty of them.
367-130732-0023	 All of the better class restaurants, however, will serve them if you order them.
367-130732-0024	 This is the recipe for 8 people and it is well worth trying if you are giving a dinner of importance.
367-130732-0025	 This is Crawfish.
367-130732-0026	 Take 30 crawfish from which remove the gut containing the gall in the following manner. Take firm hold of the crawfish with the left hand so as to avoid being pinched by its claws. With the thumb and forefinger of the right hand, pinch the extreme end of the central fin of the tail. And with a sudden jerk, the gut will be withdrawn.
367-130732-0027	 Mincer cut into small dice of carrot, an onion, one head of celery and a few parsley roots. And to these add a bay leaf, a sprig of thyme, a little minonep pepper and two ounces of butter.
367-130732-0028	 Put these ingredients into a stew pan and fry them 10 minutes. Then throw in the crawfish and pour on them half a bottle of French white wine.
367-130732-0029	 Allow this to boil and then add a quarter of strong consomme and let all continue boiling for half an hour.
367-130732-0030	 Pick out the crawfish and strain the broth through a napkin by pressure into a basin in order to extract all the essence from the vegetables.
367-130732-0031	 Pick the shells of 25 of the crawfish tails, trim them neatly and set them aside until
367-130732-0032	 Reserve some of the spawn, also have the body shells with which to make the crawfish better to finish the soup.
367-130732-0033	 This butter is made as follows. Place the shells on a baking sheet in the oven to dry. Let the shells cool and then pound them in a mortar with a little lobster cool and four ounces of fresh butter. Thiraly bruising the whole together so as to make a fine paste.
367-293981-0000	 I swear, entered Sancho.
367-293981-0001	 I say so, continue Don Quixote, because I hate taking away anyone's good name.
367-293981-0002	 I say, Repite Sancio, that I swear to hold my tongue about it till the end of your worship stays, and gone grat, I may be able to let it out tomorrow.
367-293981-0003	 Though your worship was not so bad they ought to have a new armcy in comparable beauty you spoke of, but I, what did I have? Except the heaviest wax that I think I had in all my life.
367-293981-0004	 Unlocking me into the mother that bore me.
367-293981-0005	 Didn't I say so? Worst luck to my lines, Hatsuncho.
367-293981-0006	 It cannot be the more answered Donkey Hode, but those under enchantment do not let themselves be seen by anyone.
367-293981-0007	 If they do not let themselves be seen, they let themselves be felt, said Sonshoek, if not let my shoulders speak to the point.
367-293981-0008	 Mike had speak too, said Donkey Hode, but that is not a suspicion reason for believing that what we see is the enchanted more.
367-293981-0009	 The officer's turn to him and said, well how goes a good man?
367-293981-0010	 Sonsra got up with pain enough in his bones and went after the Inkeeper in the dark, in meaning the officer who was looking to see what had become of his enemy. He said to him, "'Sinjor, whoever you are, do us the favor and kindness to give us a little rosemary, oil, salt and white, for it is water to cure one of our best nights, Aaron, on earth, who lies on your underbed, wounded by the hands of the enchanted more that is in this inn.'"
367-293981-0011	 To be brief, he took the materials of which he made a compound mixing them all and boiling them a good while it until it seemed to him they had come to perfection.
367-293981-0012	 Sancho Panzer, who also regarded the amendment of his master as miraculous, begged him to give him what was left in the Pixkin, which was no small quantity.
367-293981-0013	 Donkey Hode is considered and he, taking it with both hands and good faith and with a better will, go up to down and drained a very little lessons master.
367-293981-0014	 If your worship knew that, return Sato, won't be tied me in all my kindred. Why did you let me taste it?
367-293981-0015	 Search your memory and if you find anything of this kind you need only tell me of it and I promise you by the order, knighthood, which I have received to procure you satisfaction and reparation to the utmost of your desire.
367-293981-0016	 Then this is an in, said donkey, hooray.
367-293981-0017	 In a very respectable one said the inkeeper
367-293981-0018	 The cries of the poor, blanketed wretch were so loud that they reached the ears of his master, who, halting to listen attentively, was persuaded that some new adventure was coming, until he clearly perceived that it was his squire who uttered them.
367-293981-0019	 He saw him rising and falling in the air with such grace and nimbleness that had his rage allowed him, and is my belief he would have left.
367-293981-0020	 Sancho took it and as he was raising into his mouth he was stopped by the cries of his master exclaiming, Sancho, my son, drink not water, drink not my son for it will kill the sea. Here I have the blessed bosom and he held up the flask of liquor. And with drinking two drops of it that will certainly be restored.
3764-168670-0000	 The strides of a lame man are like the ogling glances of a one-eyed man. They do not reach their goal very properly.
3764-168670-0001	 Gazette had waked up.
3764-168670-0002	 Jean-Varjant had placed her near the fire.
3764-168670-0003	 You will wait for me at a lady's house. I shall come to fetch you.
3764-168670-0004	 Everything is ranged and nothing is. So for Shlouven.
3764-168670-0005	 I have permission to bring you in, but before bringing you in, you must be got out.
3764-168670-0006	 That's where the difficulty lies.
3764-168670-0007	 It is easy enough with the child. You will carry her out.
3764-168670-0008	 and she will hold her tongue, I answer for that.
3764-168670-0009	 Foshe Levant grumbled, moat to himself, and to Jean-Vagant.
3764-168670-0010	 You understand Father Madeline, the government will notice it.
3764-168670-0011	 Jawasron stared him straight in the eye and thought that he was raven.
3764-168670-0012	 Fous�書ément Claire
3764-168670-0013	 It is tomorrow the time to bring you in, the prior SX-X.
3764-168670-0014	 Then he explained to Jean-Vagant that this was his recompense for a service which he, Fosch Levant, was to render to the community.
3764-168670-0015	 that the nun who had died that morning had requested to be buried in the coffin which had served her for a bed, and interred in the vault under the altar of the chapel.
3764-168670-0016	 that the Priarest and the vocal mothers intended to fulfil the wish of the deceased.
3764-168670-0017	 that he, Fushle-Livon, was to nail up the coffin in the cell, raise the stone in the chapel and blow the corpse into the vault.
3764-168670-0018	 And then that there was another, the empty coffin.
3764-168670-0019	 What is that empty coffin?
3764-168670-0020	 Hasta zum vasjon! Fau fil de� reclouvert!
3764-168670-0021	 What coffin? What administration?
3764-168670-0022	 Fush Levant, who was seated, sprung up as though a ball might burst under his chair. You!
3764-168670-0023	 You know for sure what you have said, Mother Crucifixion is dead.
3764-168670-0024	 and I add and Father Madeline is buried. Ah!
3764-168670-0025	 You are not like other men, Sother Madeline.
3764-168670-0026	 This offers the means. Give me some information in the first place.
3764-168670-0027	 How long is the coffin? 6 feet?
3764-168670-0028	 It is a chamber on the ground floor which has a grated window opening on the garden which is closed on the outside by a shutter and Two doors one leads into the convent the other into the church. What church?
3764-168670-0029	 the church in the street, the church which anyone can enter.
3764-168670-0030	 Have you the keys to those two doors?
3764-168670-0031	 No, I have the key to the door which communicates with the convent. The porter has the key to the door which communicates with the church.
3764-168670-0032	 only to allow the undertakers meant to enter when they come to get the coffin.
3764-168670-0033	 Who nails up the coffin? What I do.
3764-168670-0034	 who spreads the poor labor.
3764-168670-0035	 Not another man except the police doctor can enter the dead room. That is even written on the wall.
3764-168670-0036	 Could you hide me in that room tonight when everyone is asleep?
3764-168670-0037	 about three o'clock in the afternoon.
3764-168670-0038	 I shall be hungry. I will bring you something.
3764-168670-0039	 You can come and nail me up in the coffin at 2 o'clock.
3764-168670-0040	 Fush live on a recoiled and cracks his finger joints, but that is impossible.
3764-168670-0041	 But impossible to take a hammer and drive some nails in a plant.
3764-168670-0042	 Jean-Val Jean had been in worse straits than this.
3764-168670-0043	 Any man who has been a prisoner understands how to contract himself to fit the diameter of the escape.
3764-168670-0044	 What does not a man undergo for the sake of a cure?
3764-168670-0045	 To have himself nailed up in a case and carried off like a barrel of goods to live for a long time in a box, to find air where there is none, to economise his breath for hours, to know how to stifle without dying. This was one of Jean Valjean's gloomy talents.
3764-168670-0046	 You surely must have a gimlet. You will make a few holes here and there around my mouth, and you will nail the top plank on loosely. Good, and what if you should happen to cough or to sneeze?
3764-168670-0047	 A man who is making his escape does not cough or sneeze.
3764-168670-0048	 Who is there who has not said to a cat? Do come in.
3764-168670-0049	 The overprudent cants as they are, and because they are cants, sometimes incur more danger than the audacious.
3764-168670-0050	 But Jean Valjean's coolness prevailed over him, in spite of himself. He grumbled.
3764-168670-0051	 If you are sure of coming out of the Coltomolite, I am sure of getting you out of the grave.
3764-168670-0052	 an old, a low of the old school. The grave digger puts the corpses in the grave and I put the grave digger in my pocket.
3764-168670-0053	 I shall follow, that is my business.
3764-168670-0054	 The herds holds, the undertaker's men not a rope around your coffin, and lower you down.
3764-168670-0055	 The priest as the prayers makes the sign of the cross sprinkles the holy water and takes his departure.
3764-168670-0056	 One of two things will happen. He will either be sober or he will not be sober.
3764-168670-0057	 descentu fod beth yn gan i cwogaeth Ayn, ond pan wneudd.
3764-168671-0000	 On the following day, as the sun was declining, the very rare passes by on the boulevard du min pulled off their hats to an old-fashioned purse, ornamented with skulls, crossbones and tears.
3764-168671-0001	 This hers contained a coffin covered with a white cloth over which spread a large black cross like a huge corpse with drooping arms.
3764-168671-0002	 A morning coach in which could be seen a priest in his surplus and a choir boy in his red cap followed.
3764-168671-0003	 Behind it came an old man in the garments of a labourer who limped along.
3764-168671-0004	 The Gravediggers, being thus bound to service in the evening and summer and at night in winter, in this cemetery. They were subjected to a special discipline.
3764-168671-0005	 These gates therefore swung inexorably on their hinges at the instant when the sun disappeared behind the dome of the invalid.
3764-168671-0006	 dampness was invading it, the flowers were deserting it.
3764-168671-0007	 The bourgeois did not care much about being buried in the Vos Jecha, it hinted at poverty. Pachelaches, if you please.
3764-168671-0008	 To be buried in Percolachese is equivalent to having a funniture of mahogany. It is recognised as elegant.
3764-168671-0009	 The internment of Mother Crucifixion in the vault under the altar, the exit of Cosette, the introduction of Jean-Varjeau into the deadroom, all had been executed without difficulty and there had been no hitch. Let us remark in passing that the burial of Mother Crucifixion under the altar of the Hungveld is a perfectly venial offence in our sight.
3764-168671-0010	 It is one of the faults which resemble a duty.
3764-168671-0011	 The nuns had committed it, not only without difficulty, but even with the applause of their own consciences.
3764-168671-0012	 In the cloister, what is called the government, is only an intermeddling with authority, an interference which is always questionable.
3764-168671-0013	 Make as many laws as you please men, but keep them for yourselves.
3764-168671-0014	 The prince is nothing in the presence of a principle.
3764-168671-0015	 Fursh Levant limped along behind the hearth in a very contented frame of mind.
3764-168671-0016	 Jorval Jean's composure was one of those powerful tranquillities which are contagious.
3764-168671-0017	 What remained to be done was a mere nothing.
3764-168671-0018	 He played with Father Mesdian.
3764-168671-0019	 He did what he liked with him. He made him dance according to his whim.
3764-168671-0020	 The permission for internment must be exhibited.
3764-168671-0021	 He was a sort of labouring man who wore a waistcoat with large pockets and carried a mattock under his arm.
3764-168671-0022	 The man replied. The grave digger.
3764-168671-0023	 The... Grave Digger? Yes?
3764-168671-0024	 You... מכ.
3764-168671-0025	 Father Miss Jen is the grave digger. He was.
3764-168671-0026	 A bottle of wine had expected anything but this, but a grave digger could die.
3764-168671-0027	 It is true, nevertheless, that grave diggers do die themselves.
3764-168671-0028	 He had hardly the strength to stomach.
3764-168671-0029	 But he persisted feebly. Father Mustienne is the grave to go.
3764-168671-0030	 Do you know who little father Lynn Lara is? He is a jug of red wine.
3764-168671-0031	 But you're a jolly fellow too.
3764-168671-0032	 Are you not, Comrade? We'll go and have a drink together, presently.
3764-168671-0033	 The man replied.
3764-168671-0034	 He limped more out of anxiety than from infirmity.
3764-168671-0035	 The Gravedigger walked on in front of him.
3764-168671-0036	 Fertilove on past the unexpected CLABA once more in review.
3764-168671-0037	 Fush Le Wrong, who was illiterate but very sharp, understood that he had to deal with a formidable species of man, with a fine talker. He muttered...
3764-168671-0038	 Miss Irma, Father Mestian is dead.
3764-168671-0039	 The man replied, culturally.
3764-168671-0040	 The good god consulted his notebook, which shows when the time is up. It was Father Mestian's turn. Father Mestian died.
3764-168671-0041	 stormant-fo Tomorrow. It is Mäd.
3764-168671-0042	 You are a peasant. I am a periscent.
3764-168671-0043	 First you have all thought, I am lost.
3764-168671-0044	 There were only a few turns of the wheel distant from the small alley leading to the nuns corner.
3764-168671-0045	 and he added with the satisfaction of a serious man who is turning a phrase well.
3764-168671-0046	 Fortunately, the soil, which was light and wet with the winter rains, clogged the wheels and retarded its speed.
3764-168671-0047	 My father was a porter at the Pritanyam, Tahu.
3764-168671-0048	 But he had reverses, he had losses unchanged. I was obliged to renounce the profession of author, but I am still a public writer.
3764-168671-0049	 So you are not a great iftigger then?
3764-168671-0050	 Returned for sure, clutching at this branch, feeble as it was.
3764-168671-0051	 Here a remark becomes necessary.
3764-168671-0052	 A first lover, whatever his anguish, offered a drink, but he did not explain himself on one point. Who was to pay?
3764-168671-0053	 The grave digger went on with a superious smile.
3764-168671-0054	 One must eat.
3997-180294-0000	 The jook comes every morning. They will tell him when he comes that I am asleep, and perhaps he will wait until I awake.
3997-180294-0001	 Yes, but if I should already ask for something, what?
3997-180294-0002	 Well do it for me, why swear to you that I don't love you as the others have loved you.
3997-180294-0003	 There are bolts in the door. Rich!
3997-180294-0004	 I don't know how it is, but it seems to me as if I do.
3997-180294-0005	 Now go, I can't keep my eyes open.
3997-180294-0006	 It seems to me as if this sleeping city belongs to me. I searched my memory for the names of those who's happiness I had once envied. And I could not recall one without finding myself the happier.
3997-180294-0007	 Education, family feeling, the sense of duty, the family are strong sentinels, but there are no sentinels so vigilant as not to be deceived by a girl of 16 to whom nature, but the voice of the man she loves gives the first castle of love all the more ardent because they seem so pure.
3997-180294-0008	 The more a girl believes in goodness, the more easily will she give way, if not to her lover at least to love. For being without mistrust, she is without force, and to win her love is a triumph that can be gained by any young men of 5 and 20. See how young girls are watched and guarded.
3997-180294-0009	 Then how surely must they desire the world, which is hidden from them? How surely must they find it tempting? How surely must they listen to the first voice, which comes to tell its secrets through their bars? And bless the hand which is the first to raise a corner of the mystery veil.
3997-180294-0010	 With them, the body has worn out the soul. The senses have burned up the heart. Disappear has blunted the feelings.
3997-180294-0011	 They love by profession and not by instincts.
3997-180294-0012	 When a creature who has all her past to report yourself with is taken all at once by a profound sincere, irresistible love of which she had never felt to self-peopleable, when she has confessed her love, how absolutely the man whom she loves dominates her.
3997-180294-0013	 They know not what proof to give.
3997-180294-0014	 In order to disturb the laborers in the field was one day devoured by a wolf. Because those whom he had so often deceived no longer believed in his cries for help.
3997-180294-0015	 This is the same with these unhappy women when they love seriously.
3997-180294-0016	 But when the man who inspires this redeeming love is great enough and soul to receive it without remembering the past, when he gives himself up to it, when in short he loves as he is loved, this man drains at one drought all earthly emotions, and after such a love, his heart will be closed to every other.
3997-180294-0017	 But to return to the first day of my liaison.
3997-180294-0018	 When I reached home, I was in the state of Mad Data Team.
3997-180294-0019	 The woman becomes the man's mistress and loves him.
3997-180294-0020	 How? Why?
3997-180294-0021	 My whole being was exalted into joy at the memory of the words we had exchanged during that first night.
3997-180294-0022	 Here are my orders, tonight at the Valleville.
3997-180294-0023	 Come during the third and trance.
3997-180294-0024	 The box is killed one after another.
3997-180294-0025	 Only one remains empty, a stage box.
3997-180294-0026	 At the beginning of the third act, I heard the door of the box on which my eyes had been almost constantly fixed, open, and my arteries appeared.
3997-180294-0027	 Does she love me enough to believe that the more beautiful she looks, the happier I should be?
3997-180294-0028	 What is the matter with you tonight, said Margaret, rising and coming to the back of the box and kissing me on the forehead?
3997-180294-0029	 You should go to bed she replied with that ironic era which went so well with her delicate and witty face.
3997-180294-0030	 Where? At home?
3997-180294-0031	 You still love me? Can you ask?
3997-180294-0032	 Because you don't like seeing him.
3997-180294-0033	 Nonetheless, I was very unhappy all the rest of the evening and went away very sadly after having seen prudence, account and Margory get into the carriage which was winning for them at the door.
3997-180297-0000	 I have not come to hinder you from leaving Paris.
3997-180297-0001	 You and the way, Margrette, but how?
3997-180297-0002	 Well, you might have had a woman here, said Putin's, and it would hardly have been amusing for her to see two more arrive.
3997-180297-0003	 During this remark, Margulese looked at me attentively.
3997-180297-0004	 My dear prudence I answered, he do not know what you are saying.
3997-180297-0005	 Yes, but besides not wishing to put you out, I was sure that if you came as far as my door, you would want to come up. And as I could not let you, I did not wish to let you go away blaming me for saying no.
3997-180297-0006	 Because I am watched and the least suspicion might do me the greatest harm.
3997-180297-0007	 Is that really the only reason?
3997-180297-0008	 If there were any other I would tell you, for we are not to have any secrets from one another now.
3997-180297-0009	 Honestly, do you care for me a little? A great deal.
3997-180297-0010	 I fancy it for a moment that I might give myself that happiness for six months. You will not have it. You insisted on knowing the means.
3997-180297-0011	 Well good heavens, the means were easy enough to guess.
3997-180297-0012	 I listened and I gazed at Margaret with admiration.
3997-180297-0013	 When I thought that this marvelous creature whose feet I had once longed to kiss was willing to let me take my place in her thoughts, my part in her life, and that I was not yet content with what she gave me, I asked if men's desire had indeed limits. When satisfied as probably as mine had been, it reached after something further.
3997-180297-0014	 Truly, she continued, we poor creatures of chance have fantastic desire and inconceivable loves.
3997-180297-0015	 We are not allowed to have hearts on the penalty of being put down and of ruining our credit.
3997-180297-0016	 We no longer belong to ourselves.
3997-180297-0017	 We stand first in their softest team, last in their steam.
3997-180297-0018	 Never do they give you advice which is not lucrative.
3997-180297-0019	 It means little enough to them that we should have 10 lovers extra, as long as they get dresses or a bracelet out of them. And that they can drive and are encouraged from time to time or come to our box at the theatre.
3997-180297-0020	 Such a man I found in the Duke, but the Duke is old and the old age neither protects nor consoles.
3997-180297-0021	 I thought I could accept the life which he offered me, but what would you have?
3997-180297-0022	 What I loved and knew was not the man who was, but the man who was going to be.
3997-180297-0023	 Margarit, tired out with his long confession, threw herself back on the sofa, and to stifle a slight cough, pull up her hand-gacheeve tour lips, and from that tour eyes.
3997-180297-0024	 Margarit, do with me as you will. I am your slave, your dog, but the name of heaven tear up the letter which I wrote to you and do not make me leave you tomorrow. It would kill me.
3997-180297-0025	 Marguerite drew the letter from her bosom, and handing it to me with a smile of infinite sweetness said.
3997-180297-0026	 Here it is. I have brought it back.
3997-180297-0027	 I tore the letter into fragments and kissed with tears the hand that gave it to me.
3997-180297-0028	 Look here, Putin's. Do you know what he wants? Set, moderate.
3997-180297-0029	 He wants you to forgive him.
3997-180297-0030	 One has to, but he wants more than that. What then?
3997-180297-0031	 I embraced Marg Witt until she was almost stifled.
3997-182399-0000	 almost a buzzardy grand.
3997-182399-0001	 This sounded like another story.
3997-182399-0002	 He was curious about that black-headed cousin of all Mr. Buzzard, very curious indeed.
3997-182399-0003	 Anyway, he would find out...
3997-182399-0004	 Please Mr. Bowser, please tell us the story. He begged.
3997-182399-0005	 Now, all Mr. Buzzard is naturally good-natured and accommodating, and when Peter bagged so hard, he just couldn't find it in his heart to refuse.
3997-182399-0006	 Way back in the days, when Grandpa Buzzerd had his little falling out with old King Eagle, and then flies so high he scorched the feathers off in his head, he had a cousin, did Grandpa Buzzerd, and this cousin was just naturally lazy and no count.
3997-182399-0007	 Like most no-count people, he used to make a regular nuisance of himself, poking his nose into everybody's business and never turning to his own.
3997-182399-0008	 Wasn't anything going on that this tripling member of the Bussard family didn't find out about a medal in? He could ask more questions than Peter Rabbit can and anybody that can do that has got to ask a lot
3997-182399-0009	 Everybody looks at Peter and last.
3997-182399-0010	 So, Williams said on the chimney tops whenever all jackfoss gets to strain down where he have no business.
3997-182399-0011	 One day, this no-count trifling cousin of Grand Pop buzzard get cold in his feet.
3997-182399-0012	 It was on the little old house, a little old tumble-down house.
3997-182399-0013	 Why, he just stretched his full head as far down the chimney as he came and listened and listened.
3997-182399-0014	 But you don't mind that.
3997-182399-0015	 Will you all please speak a little louder, he holler down the chimney, just like that.
3997-182399-0016	 Yes, ah, she surely was plum-scared.
3997-182399-0017	 We like to choke that no comp buzzer to death.
3997-182399-0018	 when he get home he try and try to brush the suit off but it doesn't get into the skin and it's stay there
3997-182399-0019	 A little sigh of satisfaction went round the circle of listeners.
3997-182399-0020	 It was just as good as one of grandfather frogs.
4198-12259-0000	 Draw, reach, fill, mix, give it me without water.
4198-12259-0001	 So, my friend, so, whip me off this glass neatly. Bring me here to some clarity. A full weeping glass till it run over.
4198-12259-0002	 a cessation and truth with thirst.
4198-12259-0003	 You have cast the cold gamma? Yeah, for Su-th sir.
4198-12259-0004	 By the belly of St. Buff, let us talk about a drink. I never drink but at my hours, like the Pope's Mule.
4198-12259-0005	 Which was first, those did ranking.
4198-12259-0006	 What? It seems I do not drink, but buy an attorney.
4198-12259-0007	 Drink always and you shall never die.
4198-12259-0008	 If I drink not, I am a ground, dry, graveled and spent. I am stark dead without drink, and my soul ready to fly into some marsh amongst frogs. The soul never dwells in a dry place. Drought kill it, then.
4198-12259-0009	 He drinks in vain that feels not the pleasure of it.
4198-12259-0010	 It is enough to break both GERG and PETRAL.
4198-12259-0011	 What difference is there between a bottle and a flagging?
4198-12259-0012	 Bravely and well played upon the words.
4198-12259-0013	 Our father's drink lustily and emptied their cans.
4198-12259-0014	 Well, Kackle. Well, son.
4198-12259-0015	 Come, let us drink. Will you send nothing to the river?
4198-12259-0016	 I drink no more than a sponge.
4198-12259-0017	 I drink like a temp law night.
4198-12259-0018	 And I town Quar hope sponsor
4198-12259-0019	 and I, Secret Teresinakua.
4198-12259-0020	 Give me a synonym for a gamin of bacon.
4198-12259-0021	 It is the compulsory of drinkers. It is a pulley.
4198-12259-0022	 A little rain and a laze a great deal of wind. Long tippling breaks the thunder.
4198-12259-0023	 But if there came such liquor from my ballot, will you not willingly there after suck the other once it issued?
4198-12259-0024	 Here page fill.
4198-12259-0025	 I appeal from thirst and disclaim its jurisdiction.
4198-12259-0026	 I was wont here to for it to drink out all, but now I leave nothing.
4198-12259-0027	 Hey there, here a trike fit for our sport and in earnest excellent go-to-billials of the Dunox, you know, with the black street.
4198-12259-0028	 O for God's sake, let us last them soundly, yet thriftily.
4198-12259-0029	 Sparrows would not eat, unless you bob them on a tail, nor can I drink if I be not fairly spoke to.
4198-12259-0030	 Oh this was bang it soundly.
4198-12259-0031	 But they saw banish it utterly.
4198-12259-0032	 Let us wind our horns by the sound of flaggums and bottles and cry aloud. There whoever have lost his thirst, come now hither to seek it.
4198-12259-0033	 The great God made the planets and we make the platters neat.
4198-12259-0034	 Apatite comes with eating, says Angustin, but the thirst goes away with drinking.
4198-12259-0035	 I have a remedy against thirst, quite contrary to that which is good against the biting of a man dog.
4198-12259-0036	 White wine here. Wine boys!
4198-12259-0037	 Oh, Lachromo Christi, it is of the best grape.
4198-12259-0038	 I face pure Greek, Greek, all the fine white wine.
4198-12259-0039	 There is no enchantment nor charm there. Every one of you has seen it.
4198-12259-0040	 My practice is out. I'm a free man at this trade
4198-12259-0041	 I should say, Master Path.
4198-12259-0042	 All the drinkers, those that are dry, all 4-30 souls.
4198-12259-0043	 Clear off. Meet Supernaculum.
4198-12281-0000	 Although the plague was there in the most part of all the houses, they nevertheless entered everywhere, then plundered and carried away all that was within. And yet for all this, not one of them took any hurt, which is a most wonderful case.
4198-12281-0001	 I beseech you think upon it.
4198-12281-0002	 Nevertheless, at all, ventures they wrang the bells, add capitulum, capitulantees.
4198-12281-0003	 By the virtue of God, why do not you sing? Paniers, farewell, vintage is done?
4198-12281-0004	 by the belly of St. James, which shall we pour devil's drink the while.
4198-12281-0005	 Lord God, the Mehipotent.
4198-12281-0006	 Let him be carried to prison for troubling the divine service.
4198-12281-0007	 Wherefore is it that our devotions were instituted to be short in the time of harvest and vintage and long in the advent and all the winter?
4198-12281-0008	 Arque my masters, you that love the wine. Cops body, follow me, for St. Anthony burned me as freely as a faggot. They get leave to taste one drop of the liquor that will not now come and fight for relief of the vine.
4198-12281-0009	 To others again he undrinked the Spawn Deals or Knuckles of the neck. This figured their chaps, gashed their faces, made their cheeks hang flapping on their chin, and so swinged and belamed them that they fell down before him like hay before him more.
4198-12281-0010	 To some, with a smart sews on the epicaster, he would make their midriff swag, then redoubling the blow, gave them such a home push on the naval that he made their puddings to gush out.
4198-12281-0011	 Belief that it was the most horrible spectacle that ever one saw.
4198-12281-0012	 Oh, the Holy Lady Nightage said one. The good Sanctus. Oh, our Lady of Sakura's said another. Help, help!
4198-12281-0013	 Some died without speaking. Others spoke without dying. Some died in speaking. Others spoke in dying.
4198-12281-0014	 Can you tell with what instruments they did it?
4198-12281-0015	 In the meantime, Friar John, with his formidable baton of the cross, got to the breach which the enemies had made, and there stood to snatch up those that endeavored to escape.
4198-61336-0000	 It is significant to note in this connection that the new king was an unswerving adherent of the cult of Asher by the adherents of which he was probably strongly supported.
4198-61336-0001	 At the beginning of his reign, there was much social discontent and suffering.
4198-61336-0002	 Well, might Shardura's explain in the words of the Prophet. Where is the King of Arpaed?
4198-61336-0003	 Tiglath Belizeur, however, crossed the Euphrates and moving northward, delivered and unexpected attack on the Gratian Army and Kumak.
4198-61336-0004	 A fierce battle ensued, and one of his dramatic incidents was a single combat between the rival kings.
4198-61336-0005	 An attempt was made to capture King Chadorus, who leapt from his chariot and made hasty escape on horseback, hardly pursued in the gathering darkness by an ascetic contingent of cavalry.
4198-61336-0006	 Despite the blow-delt against your ear to, a series did not immediately regain possession of North Syria.
4198-61336-0007	 the Shifty Matty Illieu, either cherish the hope that Shardurus would recover strength in again invade North Syria, or that he might himself establish an empire in that region.
4198-61336-0008	 Tiglath's Beliezer had therefore to march westward again.
4198-61336-0009	 For three years he conducted vigorous campaigns in the Western land where he met with vigorous resistance
4198-61336-0010	 Our pad was captured and met to ill you, deposed and probably put to death.
4198-61336-0011	 Once again, the Hebrews came into contact with the Zaria.
4198-61336-0012	 Its fall may not have been unconnected, with the trend of events in the Syria during the closing years of the Middle Empire.
4198-61336-0013	 GOS, the grandson of J.H.U. had achieved successes in conflict with Damascus.
4198-61336-0014	 Six months afterward, he was assassinated by Shalom.
4198-61336-0015	 This usurper held sway at Samaria for only a month.
4198-61336-0016	 No resistance was possible on the part of many him, the Usurper, who was probably ready to welcome the Assyrian conqueror so that by arranging an alliance, he might secure his own position.
4198-61336-0017	 Take-lath Polizor next operated against the median and other hill tribes in the northeast.
4198-61336-0018	 He overthrew buildings, destroyed orchards, and transported to Nineveh, those of their inhabitants he had not put to this ward, with all the livestock he could lay hands on.
4198-61336-0019	 Thus was Eurotu crippled and humiliated. It never regained its form of prestige among the Northern states.
4198-61336-0020	 In the following year, Tiglath Belize returned to Syria.
4198-61336-0021	 Many him King of Israel had died and was succeeded by his son, Pekahaya.
4198-61336-0022	 Judah had taken advantage of the disturbed conditions in Israel to assert its independence.
4198-61336-0023	 He condemned Israel for its idolatries in Christ.
4198-61336-0024	 For thus, say the Lord unto the house of Israel, seek ye me and ye shall live. Have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?
4198-61336-0025	 The remnant of the Philistine Salperes.
4198-61336-0026	 Israel was also dealt with.
4198-61336-0027	 He swept through Israel like a hurricane.
4198-61336-0028	 The philestines and their rabies of the desert were also subdued.
4198-61336-0029	 invaded Babylonia.
4198-61336-0030	 Eukinger took refuge in his capital, Sapia, which held out successfully, although the surrounding country was ravaged and dispoiled.
4294-14317-0000	 As I thought that this was due to some fault in the earth, I wanted to make these first experiments before I took my persias.
4294-14317-0001	 When I saw this bust came out sharp and clean, I said it once to construct a little furnace in the workshop erected for me by the Duke. After my own plans and design, in the house which the Duke had given me.
4294-14317-0002	 It was an extremely difficult task, and I was anxious to observe all the niceties about which I learned, so as not to lapse into some error.
4294-14317-0003	 I, in my turn, feel the same desire and hope to play my part like them. Therefore, my Lord, give me the leave to go.
4294-14317-0004	 But beware of letting Ben Nello quit you, rather, bestow upon him always more than he demands. For Fie goes into foreign parts, his ignorance is so presumptuous that he is just the man to disgrace our most illustrious school.
4294-14317-0005	 I ask no further reward for my labors up to this time than the gracious favor of your most illustrious ex-lancy.
4294-14317-0006	 Then I thanked him and said I had no greater desire than to show those envious folk that I had it in me to execute the promised work.
4294-14317-0007	 I had better look to my conduct for it who come to his ears, that I relied upon his favorite to take in first one man and then another.
4294-14317-0008	 I begged his most lust, earth's excellency to name a single person why had ever taken in.
4294-14317-0009	 I said, My Lord, I thank You, and beg You to condescend so far as to listen to four words. It is true that He let me a pair of old scales, two emphills, and three little hammers, which articles I begged His workmen, George O. Cortona, fifteen days ago to fetch back.
4294-14317-0010	 George, you came for them his health.
4294-14317-0011	 I hope to prove on what account that Scoundrel tries to bring me into this grace.
4294-14317-0012	 When he had heard this speech, the Duke rose up an anger and sent for Bernadone, who was forced to take flight as far as Venice. He and Antonio Landy with him.
4294-14317-0013	 you would better put this to the proof and I will go at once to the bargello.
4294-14317-0014	 I am willing to enter into competition with the ancients and feel able to surpass them. For since those early days in which I made the medals of Pope Clement, I have learned so much that I can now produce far better pieces of the kind. I think I can also outdo the coins I struck for Duke Galisandro, which are still held in high esteem. In like manner, I could make for you large pieces of gold and silver plate. As I did so often for that noble monarch, King Francis of France, thanks to the great conveniences he allowed me, without ever losing time for the execution of colossal statues or other works of the sculptors' craft.
4294-14317-0015	 After several months were wasted and Pietro wouldn't either work nor putment to work on the piece, I made him give it back.
4294-14317-0016	 Among artists, certain in rage sculptors laughed at me, and called me the new sculptor.
4294-14317-0017	 Now, I hope to show them that I am an old sculptor, if God shall grant me the boon of finishing my purchase for that noble piyata of his most illustrious excellency.
4294-14317-0018	 Having this excellent resolve and heart, I reached my home.
4294-32859-0000	 Wilder was rather surly after the ladies had floated away from the scene, and he drank his liquor doggedly.
4294-32859-0001	 It was his fancy, I suppose, to revive certain sentimental relations which had it maybe once existed between him and Miss Lake, and he was a person of that combative temperament that magnifies an object in proportion as its pursuit is thwarted.
4294-32859-0002	 the story of Friedelvin and wretches pretty outlines.
4294-32859-0003	 Sit down beside me and I'll tell you the story.
4294-32859-0004	 He assisted at it, but took no part, and in fact was listening to that other conversation which sounded with its pleasant gabble and laughter, like a little musical tinkle of bells in the distance.
4294-32859-0005	 But Honest Mark forgot that young ladies do not always come out quite alone and jump unassisted into their vehicles.
4294-35475-0000	 But the middle son was little and lorn. He was neither dark nor fair. He was neither handsome nor strong.
4294-35475-0001	 Throwing himself on his knees before the king he cried. O royal sire, the stoe upon me also a sword and a steed, that I may up and await all of my brethren.
4294-35475-0002	 But the king laughed him to scorn. Rao, a sword, equal.
4294-35475-0003	 Insooth thou shalt have one, but it shall be one befitting thy maiden size and courage. It's so small a weapon can be found in all my kingdom.
4294-35475-0004	 Fourth, with the grinning gesture, began shrieking with laughter, so that the bells upon his motley cap were all set of jangling.
4294-35475-0005	 I did but laugh to think the sword of Ethelry'd had been so quickly found respond to the jester, and he pointed to the scissors hanging from the tailor's girdle.
4294-35475-0006	 One night as he lay in a deep forest, too unhappy to sleep, he heard a noise near at hand in the bushes.
4294-35475-0007	 Thou shalt have thy liberty, he cried, even though thou shalt's when man pieces the moment thou art free.
4294-35475-0008	 Yet it suddenly disappeared and in its place stood a beautiful fairy with filmy wings, with shan-like rainbows in the moonlight.
4294-35475-0009	 At this moment, there was a distant rumbling as a thunder. Tis the ogre cried the ferry, we must hasten.
4294-35475-0010	 Scissors, grow a giant's height and save us from the ogres might.
4294-35475-0011	 He could see the ogre standing powerless to hurt him on the other side of the chasm and gnashing his teeth. Each one of which was as big as a millstone.
4294-35475-0012	 The sight was so terrible that he turned on his heel and fled away as fast as his feet could carry him.
4294-35475-0013	 thou shalt not be left a prisoner in this stismal spot while I have the power to help thee.
4294-35475-0014	 He lifted the scissors and with one stroke destroyed the web and gave the fly its rhythm.
4294-35475-0015	 A faint limer of light on the opposite wall shows me the keyhole.
4294-35475-0016	 The prince spent all the following time until midnight, trying to think of a suitable verse to say to the scissors.
4294-35475-0017	 As he uttered the words, the scissors leaped out of his hand and began to cut through the wooden shudders as easily as through a cheese.
4294-35475-0018	 in a very short time the prints and crawled through the opening.
4294-35475-0019	 While he stood looking around him and bewilderment, a firefly allotted on his heart, flashing its little lantern in the prince's face at cry. This way, my friend, the fly sent me to guide you to a place of safety.
4294-35475-0020	 What has to become of me, cried the poor peasant?
4294-35475-0021	 My grain must fall and rot in the field from over-ripeness because I have not the strength to rise and harvest it. Then indeed must we all starve.
4294-35475-0022	 The grand-dame, whom he supplied with faggot's the merchant, whom he rescued from robbers, the King's counsellor to whom he gave aid, all became his friends. Up and down the land, beggar, lord, homeless wanderer, or high-born dame, he gladly gave unselfish service, all in sought, and such as he helped straight away became his friends.
4294-35475-0023	 to him who could bring her back to her father's castle should be given the throne and kingdom, as well as the princess herself. So from far and near, indeed, from almost every country under the sun, came knights and princes to fight the ogre.
4294-35475-0024	 Among those who drew back were Ethel Reed's brothers, the three that were dark and the three that were fair.
4294-35475-0025	 But Ethel read, he did not their taunts.
4294-35475-0026	 So they all cried out long and loud. Long live the prince. Prince Sizou!
4294-9934-0000	 He felt what the earth may possibly feel at the moment when it is torn open with the iron, in order that grain may be deposited within it. It feels only the wound, the quiver of the germ, the joy of the fruit only arrived later.
4294-9934-0001	 He'd but just acquired a faith. Must he then reject it already?
4294-9934-0002	 He affirmed to himself that he would not, he declared to himself that he would not doubt, and he began to doubt, in spite of himself.
4294-9934-0003	 to stand between two religions, from one of which you have not as yet emerged and another into which you have not yet entered is intolerable. And twilight is pleasing only to bat-like souls.
4294-9934-0004	 Marius was clear-eyed, and he required the true light.
4294-9934-0005	 the half lights of doubt paint him.
4294-9934-0006	 Whatever may have been his desire to remain where he was, he could not halt there. He was irresistibly constrained to continue, to advance, to examine, to think, to march further.
4294-9934-0007	 He feared, after having taken so many steps which had brought him nearer to his father, to now take a step which should estranged him from that father.
4294-9934-0008	 His discomfort was augmented by all the reflections which occurred to him.
4294-9934-0009	 In the troubled state of his conscience, he no longer thought of certain serious sides of existence.
4294-9934-0010	 They soon elbowed him abruptly.
4294-9934-0011	 Request Kofaak to come and talk with me, Sid Marius.
4294-9934-0012	 What is to become of you?" said Kofarak.
4294-9934-0013	 What are you going to do? I do not know
4294-9934-0014	 Silver gold here it is
4294-9934-0015	 You will then have only a pair of trousers, a waistcoat, a hat, and a coat, and my boots.
4294-9934-0016	 That will be enough.
4294-9934-0017	 No, it is not good. What will you do after that?
4294-9934-0018	 Do you know German? No.
4294-9934-0019	 It is badly paid work, but one can live by it.
4294-9934-0020	 The clothes deal they were sent for.
4294-9934-0021	 He paid 20 francs for the cast-off garments. They went to the watchmakers.
4294-9934-0022	 He bought the watch for 45 francs.
4294-9934-0023	 Hello, I'd forgotten that, Sudmarias.
4294-9934-0024	 The landlord presented his bill, which had to be paid on the spot.
4294-9934-0025	 I have ten Frank's left, Sid Morris.
4294-9934-0026	 That will be swallowing a tongue very fast or a hundred-sew very slowly.
4294-9934-0027	 One morning, on his return for the law school, Mary's found a letter from his aunt and a 60-pistol that is to say 600 francs in gold and a sealed box.
4294-9934-0028	 Maria sent back the thirty Louis Tuzant, with the respectful letter, in which he stated that he had sufficient means of subsistence and that he should be able then's forth to supply all his needs.
4294-9934-0029	 At that moment, you had three francs left.
4350-10919-0000	 He perceived that it was no good talking to the old man, and that the principal person in the house was the mother.
4350-10919-0001	 Before her, he decided to scatter his pearls.
4350-10919-0002	 The princess was distracted and did not know what to do. She felt she had sinned against Kay.
4350-10919-0003	 Well doctor decide our fate and set the princess. Tell me everything.
4350-10919-0004	 Is there hope she meant to say, but her lips quivered and she could not out of the question? Well, doctor.
4350-10919-0005	 As you please, the princess went out with the sigh.
4350-10919-0006	 the family doctor respectfully ceased in the middle of his observations.
4350-10919-0007	 and there are indications, malnutrition, nervous excitability, and so on.
4350-10919-0008	 The question stands thus, in presence of indications of tuberculosis process, what is to be done to maintain nutrition?
4350-10919-0009	 Yes, that's an understood thing, responded to the celebrated physician, again glancing at his watch.
4350-10919-0010	 The big part is the Yooski Bridge done yet, or shall I have to drive around?
4350-10919-0011	 He asked, ah, it is.
4350-10919-0012	 But well, then I can do it in 20 minutes.
4350-10919-0013	 And how about a tour abroad as the family doctor?
4350-10919-0014	 What is wanted is the means of improving nutrition and not for lowering it.
4350-10919-0015	 The family doctor listened attentively and respectfully.
4350-10919-0016	 But in favor of foreign travel, I would urge the change of habits, the removal from conditions calling a permanent success.
4350-10919-0017	 And then the mother wishes it.
4350-10919-0018	 Ah, well in that case to be sure, let them go. Only those German quacks are mischievous.
4350-10919-0019	 Oh, time's up already, and he went to the door.
4350-10919-0020	 The celebrated doctor announced to the princess a feeling of what was due from him that he hated his doing so, that he ought to see the patient once more.
4350-10919-0021	 Oh no, only a few details princess. Come this way.
4350-10919-0022	 And the mother, accompanied by the doctor, went into the drawing room to get him.
4350-10919-0023	 When the doctor came in, she flushed crimson and her eyes filled with tears.
4350-10919-0024	 She answered him and all at once got up furious.
4350-10919-0025	 Excuse me, Doctor, but there is really no object in this.
4350-10919-0026	 This is the third time you've asked me the same thing.
4350-10919-0027	 The celebrated doctor did not take offense.
4350-10919-0028	 Noobice irritability. He said to the princess, when he had left the room. However, I had finished...
4350-10919-0029	 and the doctor began scientifically explaining to the princess as an exceptionally intelligent woman, the condition of the young princess, and concluded by insisting on the drinking of the waters, which was certainly harmless.
4350-10919-0030	 But the question, should they go abroad? The doctor plunged into deep meditation as though resolving a weighty problem.
4350-10919-0031	 Finally, his decision was pronounced. They were to go abroad, but to put no faith in foreign quacks, and to apply to him in any need.
4350-10919-0032	 It seemed as though some piece of good fortune had come to pass after the doctor had gone.
4350-10919-0033	 The mother was much more cheerful when she went back to her daughter and Kitty pretended to be more cheerful.
4350-9170-0000	 Educated people of the upper classes are trying to stifle the ever-growing sense of the necessity of transforming the existing social order.
4350-9170-0001	 This is absolutely incorrect.
4350-9170-0002	 In the social conception of life, it is supposed that since the aim of life is found in groups of individuals, individuals will voluntarily sacrifice their own interests for the interests of the group.
4350-9170-0003	 The champions of the social conception of life usually try to connect the idea of authority that is of violence with the idea of moral influence, but this connection is quite impossible.
4350-9170-0004	 The man who was controlled by moral influence acts in accordance with his own desires.
4350-9170-0005	 The basis of authority is bodily violence.
4350-9170-0006	 The possibility of applying bodily violence to people is provided above all by an organization of armed men trained to act in unison and submission to one will.
4350-9170-0007	 These bands of armed men submissive to a single will are what cost to the army.
4350-9170-0008	 The army has always been and still is the basis of power.
4350-9170-0009	 Power is always in the hands of those who control the army, and all men in power, from the Roman Caesar's to the Russian and German emperors, take more interest in their army than in anything, and court popularity in the army, knowing that if that is on their side, their power is secure.
4350-9170-0010	 Indeed, it could not be otherwise.
4350-9170-0011	 Only under those conditions could the social organization be justified.
4350-9170-0012	 But since this is not the case, and on the contrary, men in power are always far from being saints, through the very fact of their possession of power, the social organization based on power has no justification.
4350-9170-0013	 Even if there was once a time when, owing to the low standards of morals and the disposition of men to violence, the existence of an authority to restrain such violence was an advantage, because the violence of the government was less than the violence of individuals. One cannot but see that this advantage could not be lasting.
4350-9170-0014	 Between the members of one state, subject to a single authority, the strife between the individuals seems still less, and the life of the state seems even more secure.
4350-9170-0015	 It was produced on one hand by the natural growth of population and on the other by struggling conquest.
4350-9170-0016	 After conquest, the power of the emperor puts an end to internal dissensions, and so the state conception of life justifies itself.
4350-9170-0017	 But this justification is never more than temporary.
4350-9170-0018	 Internal dissentions disappear only in proportion to the degree of oppression exerted by the authority over the Descentean individuals.
4350-9170-0019	 Government authority, even if it does suppress private violence, always introduces into the life of men fresh forms of violence, which tend to become greater and greater in proportion to the duration and strength of the government.
4350-9170-0020	 And therefore the oppression of the oppressed always goes on growing after the furthest limit, beyond which it cannot go without killing the goose with the golden eggs.
4350-9170-0021	 The most convincing example of this is to be found in the condition of the working classes of our epoch, who are in reality no better than the slaves of ancient times subdued by conquest.
4350-9170-0022	 So it has always been.
4350-9170-0023	 Footnote. The fact that in America the abuses of authority exist in spite of the small number of their troops not only fails to disprove this position but positively confirms it.
4350-9170-0024	 The upper clusters know that an army of 50,000 will soon be insufficient, and, no longer relying on pincotense men, they feel that the security of their position depends on the increased strength of the army.
4350-9170-0025	 The reason to which he gave expression is essentially the same as that which made the French kings and the popes engage Swiss and scotch guards, and makes the Russian authorities of today so carefully distribute the recruits, so that the regiments from the frontier are stationed in central districts, and the regiments from the center are stationed on the frontiers.
4350-9170-0026	 The meaning of the previous speech put into plain language, is that funds are needed not to resist foreign foes, but to buy under-authors, to be ready to act against the enslaved hoiling masses.
4350-9170-0027	 and this abnormal order of thanks is maintained by the army.
4350-9170-0028	 But there is not only one government. There are other governments exporting their subjects by violence in the same way, and are always ready to pound down on any other government and carry off the fruits of the toil of its enslaved subjects.
4350-9170-0029	 And so every government needs an army also to protect its booty from its neighbor brigands.
4350-9170-0030	 This increases contagious as Montesquieu pointed out 150 years ago.
4350-9170-0031	 Every increase in the army of one state, with the aim of self-defense against its subjects, becomes a source of danger for neighboring states and calls for a similar increase in their armies.
4350-9170-0032	 The despotism of the government always increases with the strength of the army and its external successes, and the aggressiveness of the government increases with its internal despotism.
4350-9170-0033	 The rivalry of the European states and constantly increasing their forces has reduced them to the necessity of having recourse the universal military service. Since by that means the greatest possible number of soldiers is obtained at the least possible expense.
4350-9170-0034	 And by this means all citizens are under arms to support the inequities practiced upon them. All citizens have become their own impressors.
4350-9170-0035	 This inconsistency has become obvious in universal military service.
4350-9170-0036	 In fact, the whole significance of the social conception of life consists in man's recognition of the barbarity of strife between individuals, and the transitorian as a personal life itself, and the transference of the aim of life to groups of persons.
4350-9170-0037	 But with universal military service, it comes to pass that men, after making every sacrifice to get rid of the cruelty of strife and the insecurity of existence, are called upon to face all the perils they had meant to avoid.
4350-9170-0038	 But instead of doing that, they expose the individuals to the same necessity of strife, substituting strife with individuals of other states for strife with neighbors.
4350-9170-0039	 The taxes raised from the people for war preparations absorb the greater part of the produce of labor which the army ought to defend.
4350-9170-0040	 The danger of war, ever ready to break out, renders all the reforms of life-social life, vain and fruitless.
4350-9170-0041	 but the fatal significance of universal military service as the manifestation of the contradiction inherent in the social conception of life is not only apparent in that.
4350-9170-0042	 Government is certain that armies are needed above all for external defense, but that is not true.
4350-9170-0043	 There are needed principally against their subjects, and every man under universal military service that comes in accomplice in all the acts of violence of the government against the citizens without any choice of his own.
4350-9170-0044	 and for the sake of plot now I'm making them.
4350-9170-0045	 I'm expected for the sake of a state to make these sacrifices to run out everything that can be precious to man, peace, family, security and human dignity.
4350-9170-0046	 Except for the state they say, we should be exposed to the attacks of evil-disposed persons in our own country.
4350-9170-0047	 We now know that threats and punishments cannot diminish their number, that that can only be done by change of environment and moral influence.
4350-9170-0048	 So that the justification of state violence on the ground of the protection that gives us from evil to slow persons, even if it had some foundation three or four centuries ago, has none whatever now.
4350-9170-0049	 Except for the state they tell us, we should not have any religion, education, culture, means of communication, and so on.
4350-9170-0050	 Without the statement, men would not have been able to form the social institutions needed for doing anything.
4350-9170-0051	 This argument too was well founded only some centuries ago.
4350-9170-0052	 The great extension of means of communication and interchange of ideas has made men completely able to dispense with state aid in forming societies, associations, corporations and congresses for scientific, economic and political objects.
4350-9170-0053	 Without governments, nations would be enslaved by their neighbors.
4350-9170-0054	 The government they tell us with its army is necessary to defend us from neighboring states who might enslave us.
4350-9170-0055	 And if defense against barbarous nations is meant, one thousandth part of the troops now under arms would be amply sufficient with that purpose.
4350-9170-0056	 The power of the state, far from being a security against the attacks of our neighbors, exposes us on the contrary to much greater danger of such attacks.
4350-9170-0057	 Even looking at it practically, Wang, that is to say, all the burdens laid on him by the state. No man can fail to see that for him personally to comply with the state demands and serve in the army, would, in the majority of cases, be more disadvantaged than to refuse to do so.
4350-9170-0058	 To resist would need independent thought and effort of which every man is not capable.
4350-9170-0059	 So much for the advantages and disadvantages of both lines of conduct for a man of a wealthy class and a presser.
4350-9170-0060	 For a man of the poor working class, the advantages and disadvantages will be the same, but with a great increase of disadvantages.
4852-28311-0000	 Say, you know something?
4852-28311-0001	 Chris looked from a nickel-plated flash light to a car jack and spark plug.
4852-28311-0002	 No one needs a job, Ben. That's Jakey Harris.
4852-28311-0003	 Okay, you said.
4852-28311-0004	 Only why didn't you ask them yourself?
4852-28311-0005	 Mike became uneasy and fished an elastic band out of his pocket, made a flick of paper and sent it soaring out in the M Street.
4852-28311-0006	 Well, he admitted I did.
4852-28311-0007	 Chris asked, and for the first time that day, the heavy weight he carried within him lifted and lightened little.
4852-28311-0008	 Think he really needs it? He pursues.
4852-28311-0009	 He would have liked to get the job for Jakey, who needed it, but somehow the task of facing Mr. Wicker. Especially now that the light was going and dusk edged into the streets was not what Chris had intended for ending the afternoon.
4852-28311-0010	 Mike's expression changed at what wants to one of Triumph, but Chris was only partially encouraged.
4852-28311-0011	 I bet you're on going after all! Just turned on him.
4852-28311-0012	 Mike was standing on the corner.
4852-28311-0013	 Oh, shucks!
4852-28311-0014	 Chris started off once more, passing a bleak little Victorian Church, perched on the hill above Mr. Wickers' house.
4852-28311-0015	 An empty lot cut into by church lane gave a look of isolation to the L-shaped brick building that served Mr. Wickers, both house and place at business.
4852-28311-0016	 The longer wing toward the back got a back door that opened on a water street. The space between the house and Wisconsin Avenue had been made into a meat oblong flower garden. Fenced off from the sidewalk by box shrugs in a white-picket fence.
4852-28311-0017	 A livid yellow stain that arisen beyond the factories and clay clouds lower and entumbled above.
4852-28311-0018	 The air was growing chill and Chris decided to finish the job.
4852-28311-0019	 All at once he wondered how his mother was and everything in him impinged and tightened itself.
4852-28311-0020	 At the foot of the hill he reached the house.
4852-28311-0021	 There were three things that always caught his eye amid the litter of dusty pieces.
4852-28311-0022	 On the left, the coil of rope, in the center, the model of a sailing ship in a green glass bottle, and on the right, the wooden statue of Venegra Boy and Baggy Trausers, the Turkish jacket, and white turban.
4852-28311-0023	 But the name still showed at the prow, and many a time, Chris, safe at home in bed, who sailed imaginary voyages in the Mirabelle.
4852-28311-0024	 He had never seen anyone go into Mr. Booker's shop, now he thought of that.
4852-28311-0025	 How then did he live and what did he ever sell?
4852-28311-0026	 A sudden car horn, welcome from this dream.
4852-28312-0000	 Of the many times he did Zaman Mr. Rooker's window and poured over the rope to ship in the Nubian boy, he had never gone into Mr. Rooker's shop.
4852-28312-0001	 So now, alone until someone should answer the bell, they looked eagerly, if uneasily, around him.
4852-28312-0002	 What with the one window in the lowering day outside along their own shop with somber?
4852-28312-0003	 Heavy hand you and beams crossed it from one side to the other.
4852-28312-0004	 Mr. Walker is back being toward the source of light. Chris could not see his face.
4852-28312-0005	 The double fans of Minute wrinkles breaking from eye-cordered a temple and joining with those over the cheekbones were drawn into the horizontal lines across the domed forehand.
4852-28312-0006	 Little tough, so white fuzz above the ears were all that remained of the antiquarian's hair, but what drew and held Chris's gaze with the old man's eyes.
4852-28312-0007	 Chris blinked and looked again. Yes, they were still there.
4852-28312-0008	 Chris Smollard. His voice came back to him.
4852-28312-0009	 Yes sir, you said.
4852-28312-0010	 I saw your sign and I know a boy who needs the job.
4852-28312-0011	 He's a schoolmate of mine.
4852-28312-0012	 J.K. Harris' name is, and he really needs the job.
4852-28312-0013	 I... I just wondered if the place was still open.
4852-28312-0014	 What he saw was a fresh, cheap, lad tall for 13 sturdy, with sincerity and good humor in his face and something sensitive and appealing about his eyes.
4852-28312-0015	 He guessed there must be a lively fire in that run beyond.
4852-28312-0016	 Would that interfere with Jakey just getting the job, sir?
4852-28312-0017	 But even as he slowly turned, the thought pierced his mind. Why have you not seen the reflection of the headlights of the cars moving up around the corner of Wall Street, not the hill toward the life of signals?
4852-28312-0018	 The room seemed overly still.
4852-28312-0019	 Then in that second, you turn and face to about.
4852-28312-0020	 The wide bow window was there before him, and three objects he liked best showing frosty in the moonlight that poured in from across the water.
4852-28312-0021	 across the water, where was the freeway?
4852-28312-0022	 It was no longer there. Nor were the high walls and smoke stacks of factories to be seen.
4852-28312-0023	 The warehouses were still there.
4852-28312-0024	 Flabbergasted and breathless, Chris was unaware that he had moved closer to pier out the window in every direction.
4852-28312-0025	 No electric signs, no laplet streets.
4852-28312-0026	 where the people's drug store had stood but half an hour before rose the roofs of what was evidentially an inn.
4852-28312-0027	 A courtyard is firstly lit by a flaring torture too. Showing a swinging sign. Now I'm going to post.
4852-28312-0028	 The post was planted at the edge of what was now abroad in Munny Road.
4852-28312-0029	 A coach with a stop piled high with luggage stamped to a halt beside the flying courtyard.
4852-28312-0030	 and moved into the end, the coach rattled off to the stable.
4852-28312-0031	 My window has a power for those few who are to see.
4852-28319-0000	 The learning of magic was by no means easy.
4852-28319-0001	 He told his master at once about Simon Goster, his hoard of money and hiding places for it.
4852-28319-0002	 Chris therefore threw himself into all the primal amenaries of his task.
4852-28319-0003	 One afternoon when he had returned after arrest. To Mr. Wicker's study, he saw that there was something new in the room. A ball with a goldfish in it stood on the table, but Mr. Wicker was not to be seen.
4852-28319-0004	 Watch it out, I do first.
4852-28319-0005	 How you've improved my boy, it's now time for you to try. This is good to change, is any?
4852-28319-0006	 Suppose I change and catch change back.
4852-28319-0007	 Mr. Walker waited patiently beside him for a few moments for Chris to get up his courage.
4852-28319-0008	 That is nothing happened with a voice like a whip Mr. Wiggler said, STARTED MONTHS!
4852-28319-0009	 This sensation spread faster and faster.
4852-28319-0010	 His head swam and he felt faint and a little sick, but he persisted through the final words.
4852-28319-0011	 he thought, no without it feeling a pry. And commenced experimenting with his tail and fins with such enthusiasm and delight at some little time, a lapse before Mr. Wickers always boom-buzz-bye.
4852-28319-0012	 74.1. 30.10.
4852-28319-0013	 The figure's shoes carved in some eastern style, at curved up pointing toes.
4852-28319-0014	 then all that once the idea came to Chris.
4852-28319-0015	 If he was to be a magician, could he make this boy come to life?
4852-28319-0016	 He squatted on his haunches, examined the carved wooden figure attentively, and felt convinced that once alive the boy would be an ideal and happy companion.
4852-28319-0017	 But how did one change inanimate to animate?
4852-28319-0018	 Chris got up and stole back to Mr. Workers' door.
4852-28319-0019	 He heard that magician going up the spiral staircase to his room above and after changing himself to a mouse to slip under the door and see that the room was really empty. With sedumes, proper shape, and open the doors of the cupboard at the far end of the room.
4852-28319-0020	 The afternoon rainy before increased in storm.
4852-28319-0021	 That's came two hours before it's time. Thunder, snarls in the sky.
4852-28319-0022	 Certain elements were to be mixed and poured at the proper time.
4852-28319-0023	 Mr. Walker began moving about upstairs. The floorboards creaked. Creeeeeeek! Creeeeeek! And still, Chris could not leave until the function fumed and glowed.
4852-28319-0024	 With infinite caution, Chris closed the door silently behind him and running like before it reached the figure of the Negro boy.
4852-28319-0025	 It was as if the stiffness melted.
4852-28319-0026	 Under his eyes, the wednesday old of cloth became rich silk, and broidery gleamed in its rarity upon the coat, and OOOH the face!
4852-28319-0027	 The wooden grin loosened, the large eyes turned, the hand holding the hard bouquet of car flowers moved. The bouquet fall.
4852-28330-0000	 They went down to their quarters first.
4852-28330-0001	 Guess Mr. Finney went to his quarters, I don't remember seeing him cross the deck or come over that way at all.
4852-28330-0002	 Next, Ned Silly was really into the home by Albert Jones who took over. Ned went on down.
4852-28330-0003	 It looks to me as if it could be a bit of an one of several people and I'll be switched if I know who. Well, give my eyes open.
4852-28330-0004	 The Mirabelle was nearing to Heady.
4852-28330-0005	 We've watered in fresh stalls to take on there.
4852-28330-0006	 Chris lost no time as soon as he could do it without being noticed and hurting down to his cabin.
4852-28330-0007	 Certainly my boy, boomed out the captain as blue eyes are brought to be keen in penetrating.
4852-28330-0008	 Mr. Finnew will be sometime on deck. We cannot be heard in here.
4852-28330-0009	 His face froze with nervousness that this might do not do as an answer, and he stood stiff and still before Captain Blizzard.
4852-28330-0010	 The captain sat forward in his chair looking at him for a long moment, considering.
4852-28330-0011	 Then you send, well, I do not care for it. I cannot say that, do.
4852-28330-0012	 The ship is more to me than wife or mother or family.
4852-28330-0013	 and paused, fingering this lower lip, looking sideways in a reflective fashion at crisp standing before him.
4852-28330-0014	 We shall say no more, but I trust you understand the responsibility you have.
4852-28330-0015	 The ship, its cargo and its men will be in your hands.
4852-28330-0016	 Yes, sir, I think I can do it safely. Or I should not try, sir.
4852-28330-0017	 Captain Blizzard's round pink-faced Creaston, it's winning smile.
4852-28330-0018	 He then went on to describe what else was to follow, the covering of the ship with leaves to make it blend with its surroundings.
4852-28330-0019	 The camouflage was not a word the captain or anyone else of his time yet understood.
4852-28330-0020	 What can be said during that time, sir? Chris thought to ask.
4852-28330-0021	 I am somewhat skilled in medicments. I have to be as a captain of a ship and the crew know it.
4852-28330-0022	 I shall say that you are in my own cabin so that I can care for you.
4852-28330-0023	 Not since he had left Mr. Wicker and Chris felt such confidence as he did in the words and actions of Captain Blizzard.
4852-28330-0024	 He knew now that his absence for as long as he had to be away would be covered up and satisfactorily only accounted for.
4852-28330-0025	 Their conversation had taken some of the while.
533-1066-0000	 When Church Arts Yon
533-1066-0001	 I knew well enough that he might be carried thousands of miles in boxcar, locked in perhaps without water or food.
533-1066-0002	 I am sure I kissed Lady, and I've had terrible moments since when I seem to remember Kissi Mr. Jameson too with the excitement.
533-1066-0003	 Fortunately, Warner and Detect were keeping Bachelor Holland large.
533-1066-0004	 Out of their first levy, they washed their dishes once a day, and they concoded queer masses according to their several abilities.
533-1066-0005	 Miss Inz, he said, stopping me as I was about to go to my room upstairs. How are your nerves tonight?
533-1066-0006	 I have none. I said happily.
533-1066-0007	 I mean, he persisted. Do you feel as though you could go through with something rather unusual?
533-1066-0008	 The most unusual thing I can't think of would be a peaceful night.
533-1066-0009	 Something is going to occur. He said.
533-1066-0010	 Put on heavy shoes and some old dark clothes and make up your mind not to be surprised at anything.
533-1066-0011	 Lady was sleeping, sleep of the just when I went upstairs, and I hunted out my things cautiously.
533-1066-0012	 They were chucking coffinantly together, but when I came down they seized.
533-1066-0013	 There were a few preparations to be made. The logs to be gone over, winter's been struck as to renew the visual and then after extinguishing the whole light we crept into darkness through the front door and into the night.
533-1066-0014	 I asked no questions.
533-1066-0015	 Once only somebody spoke, and then it was an infantic bit of profanity from Dr. Stewart when he ran into a wire fence.
533-1066-0016	 I either know what I expected.
533-1066-0017	 The doctor was puffing somewhat when we finally came to a halt.
533-1066-0018	 I confess that just that that minute even sunny side seemed a cheerful spot.
533-1066-0019	 In spite of myself, I drew my breath in sharply.
533-1066-0020	 It was Alex under too long handled space.
533-1066-0021	 Dr. Captain King look out, but no one appeared.
533-1066-0022	 There's one thing sure, I'll not be suspected of complicity.
533-1066-0023	 A doctor is generally supposed to be a handier at bearing folks than attaining them up.
533-1066-0024	 I held onto him frantically and somehow I got chairman looked down.
533-131556-0000	 But how am I to add over the 10 or 12 days that must yet elapse before they go?
533-131556-0001	 For now, couldn't you hear me as he has done? Oh.
533-131556-0002	 The word tears me in the face like a guilty confession, but it is true. I hate him. I hate him.
533-131556-0003	 I sometimes think I ought to give him credit for the good feeling he simulates so well. And then again, I think it is my duty to suspect him under the peculiar circumstances in which I am placed.
533-131556-0004	 I have done well to record them summing it up.
533-131556-0005	 They have it taken themselves to their work. I, less to divert my mind than to duplicate conversation, I provided myself with the book.
533-131556-0006	 I am too eloquent to do their character in conduct to feel any real friends it for you, and as I am without your challenge for the simulation, I cannot assume you're the appears of it.
533-131556-0007	 Up and prusing this she turns scarlets and bit her lip.
533-131556-0008	 You may go, Millicent, and you'll follow in a while. Millicent Point.
533-131556-0009	 Well, he'll blind me Ellen. Continue to cheer.
533-131556-0010	 Huh, you are suspicious.
533-131556-0011	 If I were suspicious, I replied. I should have discovered your infamy long before.
533-131556-0012	 I enjoy human length rambles as well as you. I answered, steadily fixing my eyes up an ear. And strawberry happens to be one of my favorite resorts.
533-131556-0013	 She colored again excessively and remained silent, resting her finger against her cheese, engaging into the fire.
533-131556-0014	 I watch her a few moments to the feeling of malevolent gratification. Then, moving towards the door, I can't be asked if she had anything more to say.
533-131556-0015	 Yes, yes.
533-131556-0016	 sure
533-131556-0017	 She paused, in evident disconcerching and proplexity, mingle with anger she did not show.
533-131556-0018	 I cannot renounce what is dearer than life, chew-muttered in a low-herry tone.
533-131556-0019	 If you are generous, here is a fitting opportunity for the exercise of your magnetic midi. If you are proud, here am I, arrival. Rather to acknowledge myself, your depth for an act of the most noble forbearance.
533-131556-0020	 I shall not tell him.
533-131556-0021	 Give me no thanks. It is not for your sake that I will frame.
533-131556-0022	 And mail us in, we'll tell her.
533-131556-0023	 I will not, for much such as note, infamy and disgrace of a relation.
533-131556-0024	 You use our words Mrs. Hunt and Dunn, but I can pardon you.
533-131556-0025	 How dare you mention his name to me?
533-131562-0000	 It seems very interesting, love. Said he, lifting his head and churning to her eyes too, ringing my hand and silent rage and anguish. But it's rather long. I look at it some other time, and meanwhile I'll travel you for your kids, my dear. What kids?
533-131562-0001	 At the keys of your cabinet desk, drawer and whatever else you possess, said he, rising and holding out his hand.
533-131562-0002	 The key of my vest, in fact, was at that moment in the log and the others were attached to it.
533-131562-0003	 Now then, sneered he, we must have a confiscation of property.
533-131562-0004	 and put in the case into his pocket he walked into the library.
533-131562-0005	 That and all reply the master and things were cleared away.
533-131562-0006	 Be sure hunting don't then went upstairs.
533-131562-0007	 Not her he is starting back. She is very devil for a spide.
533-131562-0008	 I didn't say I'd broken it did I? Return he.
533-131562-0009	 I shall put you up in a small monthly allowance in future for your own private expenses, and you'd need to trouble yourself any more about my concerns. I shall look out for a steward my dear. I won't expose you to temptation.
533-131562-0010	 And as for the household matters, Mrs. Gribs must be very particular in keeping her accounts. We must go up on an unchallenged new plan.
533-131562-0011	 What great discovery have you made now, Mr. Hunt in un?
533-131562-0012	 If I tend to defraud you.
533-131562-0013	 Not in money matters exactly, it seems, but it's best to keep out of the way of temptation.
533-131562-0014	 Here, Besson entered the candles and there followed the brief interval of silence. I sitting still in my chair and he is standing with his deck to fire, silently trying to fill in my despair.
533-131562-0015	 I know that they have today such feelings will return upon me.
533-131562-0016	 I try to look to him and raise my heart to heaven, but it will cleave to the dust.
533-131564-0000	 Then, hope I fear.
533-131564-0001	 Miss Ernmys is howtersly, I've been seeing it to grow before it night. And as Mr. Hargrave is still absent, and the weather was remarkably fine, I never passed the day without seeing my two friends, mealth and an answer, either there or here.
533-131564-0002	 No, unless you can tell me when to expect him home.
533-131564-0003	 I can't. If anyone wants him do you.
533-131564-0004	 It is a resolution you are performed longer though.
533-131564-0005	 We all have a bit of a liking for him, but blot them of our hearts, though he can't respect him.
533-131564-0006	 No, I'd rather be like myself than as I am.
533-131564-0007	 Never mind my plain speaking, said I. It is from the best of motives.
533-131564-0008	 But tell me, should you wish your sons to be like Mr. Huntington, or even like yourself?
533-131564-0009	 Oh no, I couldn't stand that.
533-131564-0010	 Far and Fury
533-131564-0011	 Now don't pour into a 10% of the dead.
533-131564-0012	 But hang it, that's not my fault.
533-131564-0013	 Not ears, for she's only 520.
533-131564-0014	 What did you make of me? And the children to be sure that were you hurt thus between them?
533-131564-0015	 I know they are. Bless them.
533-131564-0016	 if I would have made it to the library.
533-131564-0017	 I sought out and put into his hands two of militant sliders, one that is from London, and written during one of his wildest seasons of reckless dissipation, the other in the country, during elusive interval.
533-131564-0018	 The former was full of trouble and anguish, not accusing him, but deeply regretting his connection with his profligate companions, abusing Mr. Grimsby and others in situating bitter things against Mr. Hountainden, and most ingeniously throwing the blame of her husband's misconduct on the other men's shoulders.
533-131564-0019	 I've been a cursed radical, God knows, said he as he gave it a earth-disk quiz. But you see, if I don't make a man's for it, then me if I don't.
533-131564-0020	 If you intend to reform, invoke God's blessing is mercy in this aid, not his curse.
533-131564-0021	 God help me then, for I'm sure I need it.
533-131564-0022	 Where's Millicent?
533-131564-0023	 No, not I, said he, turning around and pushing towards me.
533-131564-0024	 Millicent flute just thanked me, overwhelming its gratitude.
533-131564-0025	 Griggy. I couldn't have influenced him, I'm sure, by anything that I could have said.
533-131564-0026	 You never tried me merely said he.
533-131564-0027	 After that, they will repair to their country home.
5442-32873-0000	 Captain, later, not look at all, like London, Dandy now.
5442-32873-0001	 There was a very natural savagery and ejection there and a wild leuron as yellow eyes. Rachel sat down.
5442-32873-0002	 A slave only think a slave
5442-32873-0003	 or frightful, frightful, is it a dream?
5442-32873-0004	 or frightful, frightful.
5442-32873-0005	 Stanley, Stanley, it would be mercy to kill me. She broke her again.
5442-32873-0006	 Bright and natty with the gin's curtains and the little toilet set out, not in elegantly and a pet piping gold French asleep on a spurt with a spurt of sugar between the wires of a scage. Her pillow is so white and unpressed with its little edging of lace.
5442-32873-0007	 When he came back to the drawing room, a toilet bottle of Oe the Clone in his hand. With her lace hankerchief, he bathed her temples and fo'head.
5442-32873-0008	 There was nothing very brotherly in his look as he peered into a pale sharp features during the process.
5442-32873-0009	 There, don't mind me, she said sharply, and getting up she looked down at her dress and thin shoes. And seeming to recollect herself, she took the candle here just sat down and went swiftly to her room.
5442-32873-0010	 and she threw back her veil and going hurriedly to the toilet mechanically surveyed herself in the glass.
5442-32873-0011	 Rachel leak Rachel leak what are you now?
5442-32873-0012	 I'll stay here, that is, in the drawing room, she answered, and the face was withdrawn.
5442-32873-0013	 He slacked into space and tapped sharply a little window of the modest post office, at which the young ladies in the pony carriage had pulled up the day before. And within which Lyoko Agut was wont to sleep in a sort of wooden box that folded up when it appeared to be a chest of drawers all day.
5442-32873-0014	 Luke took care of Mr. Larkin's dogs and groomed Mr. Wilder's horse and cleaned up his dog cart. From up being close about money and finding that the thing was to be done more cheaply that way, put up his horse and dog cart in the post office premises and so evaded the delivery charges of the Brandon Arms.
5442-32873-0015	 But Luke was not there, and Captain Lake recollecting his habits and his haunt hurried on to the silver line, which has its cable towards the common. Only about a hundred steps away, for distances are not great in Jylingdon.
5442-32873-0016	 Here were the flow of soul and of stout long pipes, long yarns and tolerably long credits, and the humble escape races of the town resulted to the, for the pleasures of a club life, and often reveled deep into the small hours of the morning.
5442-32873-0017	 Lose no time and I'll give you half a crumb.
5442-32873-0018	 Luke, the Stockholm is greasy wide awake and in a few minutes more the dark art was strungled out into the lane and the horse harnessed went between the shafts with that wonderful chuffleness with which they're there to be called up on the startling circumstances and unseasonable hours.
5442-32873-0019	 If I thought you'd fail me now, tomorrow, I should never come back. Good night, tomorrow.
5442-41168-0000	 The act said that, in case of difference with opinion, there must be a ballot.
5442-41168-0001	 He went up to the table and striking it with his fingering he shouted loudly. A ballad.
5442-41168-0002	 He was shouting for the very coarse, surji evenavidge had proposed, but it was evident that he hated him and all his party. And this feeling of hatred spread through the whole party and reled an opposition to it, the same vindictiveness, though in a more seemingly form on the other side.
5442-41168-0003	 Shouts were raised and for a moment all was confusion, so that the martial of the province had to call for auto. A ballot.
5442-41168-0004	 We shed our blood for our country.
5442-41168-0005	 The confidence of the monarch, not checking the accounts of the marshal. He's not a cashier, but that's not the point.
5442-41168-0006	 Votes please, peace.
5442-41168-0007	 They express the most implacable hatred.
5442-41168-0008	 Levin did not, in the least, understand what was a matter. And he marveled at the passion with which it was disputed, whether or not the decision above Fleurov should be put to the vote.
5442-41168-0009	 He forgot, as Sir Jeevanavich explained to him afterwards, this syllogism, that it was necessary for the public good to get rid of the martial of the province. That to get rid of the martial, it was necessary to have a majority of votes. That to get a majority of votes, it was necessary to secure Flerov's right to vote. That to secure the recognition of Flerov's right to vote, they must decide on the interpretation to be put on the act.
5442-41168-0010	 But Levin forgot all that and it was painful to him to see all these excellent persons for whom he had a respect in such an unpleasant and vicious state of excitement.
5442-41168-0011	 To escape from this painful feeling, he went away into the other room where there was nobody except the waiters at the freshman bar.
5442-41168-0012	 He particularly liked the way one great wiskered waiter who showed his con for the other younger ones and was juroured at by them, was teaching them how to fold up napkins properly.
5442-41168-0013	 Leven advanced, but utterly forgetting what he was to do and much embarrassed, he turned to Sarji even a witch with a question. Where am I to put it?
5442-41168-0014	 our fountain
5442-41168-0015	 That is a matter for each man's own decision, he sets a value.
5442-41168-0016	 Having put it in, he recollected that he ought to have thrust his left hand too, and so he thrust it in, though too late, and still more overcome with confusion, he beat a hasty retreat into the background.
5442-41168-0017	 126 for admission 98 against.
5442-41168-0018	 Sang out the voice of the secretary who could not pronounce the letter R.
5442-41168-0019	 Then there was a laugh of bottom and two knots where found in the box.
5442-41168-0020	 But the old party did not consider themselves conquered.
5442-41168-0021	 In reply, Sennadkov spoke of the trust and noblemen of the province had placed in him, the effect on them had shown him, which he did not deserve, as his only merit had been his attachment to the nobility, to whom he had devoted 12 years of service.
5442-41168-0022	 This expression in the Marshall's face was particularly touching to Levin because only the day before he had been at his house about his trusty business and had seen him in all his grand year. A kind hearted, fatherly man.
5442-41168-0023	 If there are men younger and more deserving than I, let them serve.
5442-41168-0024	 and the martiale disappears through a side door.
5442-41168-0025	 The word to proceed immediately to the election.
5442-41168-0026	 Two noble gentlemen who had a weakness for strong drink had been made drunk by the partisans of Snekhove and a third had been robbed of his uniform.
5442-41168-0027	 On learning this, the new party had made haste during the dispute about Fleurov to send some of their men in a sledge to close the stripped gentleman and to bring along one of the intoxicated to the meeting.
5442-41169-0000	 Leven did not care to eat and he was not smoking. He did not want to join his own friends. That is, Surji even a witch, Stepan Archive witch, Sversky and the rest. Because Ronsky in his Equaries uniform was standing with them in Eagle conversation.
5442-41169-0001	 He went to the window and sat down, scanning the groups and listening to what was being said around him.
5442-41169-0002	 He's such a blank odd.
5442-41169-0003	 I have told him so, but it makes no difference. Only think of it.
5442-41169-0004	 These persons were unmistakably seeking a place where they could talk without being overheard.
5442-41169-0005	 Shall we go on your Excellency Fine Champagne?
5442-41169-0006	 Last year, at a district martial, Nikola Ivenevich's.
5442-41169-0007	 Oh, still just the same, always are a loss, the landowner answered with a resigned smile, but with an expression of serenity and conviction that so it must pay.
5442-41169-0008	 Why? What is that to understand?
5442-41169-0009	 There is no meaning in it at all.
5442-41169-0010	 Then, two, one must keep up connections.
5442-41169-0011	 It's a model obligation of a sword.
5442-41169-0012	 and then to tell the truth, there's one's own interests.
5442-41169-0013	 They are proprietors of a sought, but we are the landowners.
5442-41169-0014	 That it may be, but still it ought to be treated a little more respectfully.
5442-41169-0015	 If we are laying out a garden, planning one before the house, you know, and there you have a tree that stood the centuries in the very spot. Old and knalled it may be, and yet you don't cut down the old fellow to make room for the flower beds. But lay out your beds so as to take advantage of the tree.
5442-41169-0016	 Well, and how is your land doing?
5442-41169-0017	 but one's world is thrown in for nothing.
5442-41169-0018	 Oh well, one does it. What would you have?
5442-41169-0019	 And what's more, the landowner went on leaning his elbows on the window and chatting on. My son, I must tell you, has no taste for it.
5442-41169-0020	 So there will be no one to keep it up and yet one does it.
5442-41169-0021	 We walked about the fields and the garden. No sir he, step on the slippage, everything's well looked after, but your gardens neglected.
5442-41169-0022	 To mind thinking, I cut down the laundry.
5442-41169-0023	 Here you have thousands of lines and each would make two good bundles of bark.
5442-41169-0024	 Your merit I heard, so the landowner.
5442-41169-0025	 Yes, it's rather strange, he went on.
5442-41169-0026	 The landowner chuckled under his white moustaches.
5442-41169-0027	 Why don't we cut down our box for timble?
5442-41169-0028	 said 11 returning to a thought that had struck him.
5442-41169-0029	 There's a class instinct too of what one ought an ought not to do.
5442-41169-0030	 There's the peasants too, I wonder at them sometimes. Any good peasant tries to take all the land he can.
5442-41169-0031	 Without a return 2, add a simple loss.
5484-24317-0000	 When he came from the bath, Proclus visited him again.
5484-24317-0001	 But Hermann was not in the mood to share a joyous rebel, and he frankly said so. Although immediately after his return he had accepted the invitation to the festival, which the whole fellowship of artists would give the following day and honor of the 70th birthday of the old sculptor, Euphraner.
5484-24317-0002	 She would appear herself at dessert, and the banquet must therefore begin at an unusually early hour.
5484-24317-0003	 So the artist found himself obliged to relinquish his opposition.
5484-24317-0004	 The banquet was to begin in a few hours, yet he could not let the day pass without seeing Daphne and tell her the words of the Oracle.
5484-24317-0005	 He longed with ardent yearning for the sound of her voice and still more to unburden his sorely troubled soul to her.
5484-24317-0006	 Since his return from the oracle, the fear that the rescue gemeter might yet be the work of Mertilist had again mastered him.
5484-24317-0007	 The approval, as well as the doubts, would it arise in others' strength and his opinion, although even now he could not succeed in bringing it into harmony with the facts.
5484-24317-0008	 Then he went directly to the neighboring palace. The queen might have appeared already, and it would not do to keep her waiting.
5484-24317-0009	 Heather to the merchant had been induced. It is true to advance large sums of money to the queen, but the loyal devotion which he showed to her royal husband had rendered it impossible to give him even a hint of the conspiracy.
5484-24317-0010	 When Hermann entered the residence of the Grimatius in the palace, the guests had already assembled.
5484-24317-0011	 The place by Hermann's side, which Elthia had chosen for herself, would then be given up to Arsino.
5484-24317-0012	 True, an interesting conversation still had power to charm him, but often during its continuance, the full consciousness of his misfortune forced itself upon his mind, for the majority of the subjects discussed by the artists came to them through the medium of sight, unreferred to new creations of architecture, sculpture, and painting, from whose enjoyment his blindness debared him.
5484-24317-0013	 A stranger, out of his own sphere, he fell chilled among these closely united men and women, to whom no type bound him save the presence of the same host.
5484-24317-0014	 Creates had really been invited in order to win him over to the Queen's cause. But charming fair Herod Niko had been commissioned by the conspirators to persuade him to sing Arsino's praises among his professional associates.
5484-24317-0015	 His son had been the Royal James first husband, and she had deserted him to marry Lysemakis, the aged king of Thraces.
5484-24317-0016	 The King's sister, the object of his love, cried Hermann incredulously.
5484-24317-0017	 We women are only as old as we look and the leeches entire women of this beauty of 40, practice arts which give her the appearance of 25, yet perhaps the king values her intellect more than her person, and the wisdom of a hundred serpents is certainly united in this woman's head.
5484-24317-0018	 The three most trustworthy ones are here. Aminthus, the leech chrysipus, and the admirable proclas.
5484-24317-0019	 Let us hope that you will make this three-leaved clover, the luck promising four-leaved one.
5484-24317-0020	 Your uncle, too, has often with praiseworthy generosity helped us to know in many ennembaracements.
5484-24317-0021	 How long he kept you waiting from the first word concerning a work which justly transported the whole city with delight?
5484-24317-0022	 When he did, finally semen you, he said things which must have ruled you.
5484-24317-0023	 That is going too far. Replyed hair morn.
5484-24317-0024	 He winked at her and made a significant gesture as he spoke, and then informed the blind artist how graciously Arsino had remembered him, when she heard of the remedy by who's a many a wonderful cure of blind eye had been made in roads.
5484-24317-0025	 The royal lady had inquired about him and his sufferings, with almost sisterly interest, and Althea eagerly confirmed the statement.
5484-24317-0026	 Her mom listened to the parent silence.
5484-24317-0027	 The Roddyon was just beginning to praise Arsenal also as a special friend and connoisseur of the sculpture's art when crates, Hermann's fellow student, asked the blind artist in behalf of his beautiful companion, while his demeanor was placed upon a pedestal which, to others as well as himself, seemed too high for the size of the statue.
5484-24317-0028	 Yet what mattered, even if these miserable people considered themselves deceived and pointed the finger of scorn at him.
5484-24317-0029	 A woman who yearns for the regard of all men and makes love a toy, easily lessens the demand she imposes upon individuals.
5484-24317-0030	 Only, even though love has wholly disappeared, she still claims consideration, and Althea did not wish to lose her mom's regard.
5484-24317-0031	 How indifferent you look, but I tell you, her deep blue eyes flashed as she spoke, that so long as you were still a genuine creating artist, the case was different.
5484-24317-0032	 Though so loud a denial is written on your face, I persist in my conviction and that no idle delusion and snazzy me I can prove.
5484-24317-0033	 It was, nay, it could have been nothing else, that very spider.
5484-24318-0000	 not a sound if you value your lives.
5484-24318-0001	 To offer resistance would have been madness, for even Hermon perceived by the loud clanking of weapons around them, the greatly superior power of the enemy, and they were acting by the orders of the king. To the prison near the place of execution.
5484-24318-0002	 Was he to be led to the executioner's block?
5484-24318-0003	 What pleasure had life to offer him, the blind man, who was already dead to his art?
5484-24318-0004	 or he not to greet his sudden end as a boom from the immortals?
5484-24318-0005	 Did it not spare him a humiliation as great and painful as could be imagined?
5484-24318-0006	 Whatever might await him, he desired no better fate.
5484-24318-0007	 If he had passed into annihilation he, Hermann, wished to follow him through, and annihilation certainly meant redemption from pain and misery.
5484-24318-0008	 But if he were destined to meet his fertilis and his mother in the world beyond the grave, what had he not to tell them? How sure he was a finding, a joyful reception there from both.
5484-24318-0009	 The power which delivered him over to death just at that moment was not Nemesis. No, it was a kindly deity.
5484-24318-0010	 Yet it was no illusion that deceived him.
5484-24318-0011	 Again, he heard the beloved voice, and this time it addressed not only him, but with the utmost haste the commander of the soldiers.
5484-24318-0012	 Sometimes with the touching and treaty, sometimes with impurious command, she protested, after giving him her name, that this matter could be nothing but an unfortunate mistake.
5484-24318-0013	 Lastly, with Ernest warmth, she besought him before taking the prisoners away to permit her to speak to the commanding general. Philippus, her father's guest, who she was certain, was in the palace.
5484-24318-0014	 cried hermon in grateful agitation, but she would not listen to him and follow the soldier whom the captain detailed to guide her into the palace.
5484-24318-0015	 Tomorrow you shall confess to me who treacherously directed you to this dangerous path.
5484-24318-0016	 Daphne again pleaded for the liberation of the prisoners, but Philip as silence charred with the grave exclamation, the order of the King.
5484-24318-0017	 As soon as the captive artist was alone with the woman he loved, he clasped her hand, pouring forth in coherent words of the most ardent gratitude, and when he felt her warmly return the pressure, he could not restrain the desire to clasp her to his heart.
5484-24318-0018	 In spite of his deep mental distress, he could have shouted aloud in his delighting gratitude.
5484-24318-0019	 He might now have been permitted to bind forever to his life the woman who had just rescued him from the greatest danger, but the confession he must make to his fellow artists in the bluster the following morning still sealed his lips. Yet in this hour he felt that he was united to her, and ought not to conceal what awaited him, so obeying a strong impulse he exclaimed, you know that I love you.
5484-24318-0020	 I love you and I've loved you always.
5484-24318-0021	 to have me exclaimed tenderly, what more has needed.
5484-24318-0022	 But Hermann, with drooping head murmured. Tomorrow I shall no longer be what I am now.
5484-24318-0023	 Then, after you raise your face to his, asking, so that Demeter is the work of Mertus.
5484-24318-0024	 Would it terrible or a deal again awaits you?
5484-24318-0025	 And I, fool, blinded also in mind, could be vexed with you for it.
5484-24318-0026	 Bring this before your mind and everything else that you must accept with it. If you consent, will the time arrives to become mine? Can see you in paleoid nothing.
5484-24318-0027	 So our kai is intended to leave the city on one of his own ships at very day.
5484-24318-0028	 He himself on the way to expose himself to the malice and mockery of the whole city.
5484-24318-0029	 His heart contracted painfully and his solicitude about his uncle's fate increased when Philipus informed him that the conspirators had been arrested at the banquet and headed by a mean test the Rodion, chrysipus and Proclos had perished by the executioner's sword at sunrise
5484-24318-0030	 Besides, he knew that the object of his love would not part from him without granting him one last word.
5484-24318-0031	 On the way is hard-thrubbed almost bursting.
5484-24318-0032	 Eman Daphne's image and what threatened her father and her with him was seated far into the background.
5484-24318-0033	 He was appearing before his companions only to give truth, it's just do.
5484-24318-0034	 The Egyptian obeying and his master crossed the wide space, strewn with sand, and approached the stage which had been erected for the feast of performances. Even had his eyes retain the power of sight, his blood was coursing so widely through his veins that he might perhaps have been unable to distinguish the statues around him, and the thousands of spectators who, crowded closely together, richly garlanded, their cheeks glowing with enthusiasm, surrounded the arena.
5484-24318-0035	 Shattered his friend, Sajilis, and joyful surprise in the midst of his painful walk. Hermon!
5484-24318-0036	 Even while he believed himself to be the creator of the Demeter, he had been seriously troubled by the praise of so many critics, because it had exposed him to the suspicion of having become faithful to his art and his nature.
5484-24318-0037	 Honour to Mertelis and his art, but he trusted the Snowball Feastel assemblage would pardon the unintentional deception and aid his prayer for recovery.
5764-299665-0000	 Afterward, it was supposed that he was satisfied with the blood of oxen, lambs and doth, and that in exchange, for, or in account of these sacrifices, this God gave rain, sunshine and harvest.
5764-299665-0001	 Whether he was the creator of yourself and myself.
5764-299665-0002	 whether and the prayer was ever answered.
5764-299665-0003	 Why did he create the intellectually inferior?
5764-299665-0004	 Why did he create the deform than helpless? Why did he create the criminal, the idiotic, the insane?
5764-299665-0005	 are the failures and the obligation to their creator.
5764-299665-0006	 He is irresponsible for all the wars that have been waged, for all the innocent blood that has been shed.
5764-299665-0007	 is irresponsible for the centuries of slavery, for the backs that have been scarred with a lash, for the babes that have been sold from the breasts of mothers, for the families that have been separated and destroyed.
5764-299665-0008	 Is this God responsible for religious persecution, for the Inquisition, for the Thames, Kruvent Rack, and for all the instruments of torture.
5764-299665-0009	 This got a load of cruel and vile to destroy the brave and virtuous.
5764-299665-0010	 Did he load tyrants to shed a blood of patriots?
5764-299665-0011	 Can we conceive of a devil, based enough to prefer his enemies to his friends?
5764-299665-0012	 How can we account for the wild beasts that the war human beings for the franked servants whose bite is death?
5764-299665-0013	 How can we account for a world where life fits on life?
5764-299665-0014	 Did infinite wisdom intentionally produce the microscopic beasts that feed upon the optic nurse? Think of blinding a man to satisfy the appetite of a microbe.
5764-299665-0015	 Fear builds the altar and offers the sacrifice.
5764-299665-0016	 fear, erects the cathedral and bows the head of man in worship.
5764-299665-0017	 Litz, religious and fearful, trombingly repeat this passage. Though, he slay me, yet will I trust him.
5764-299665-0018	 Can we say that he cared for the children of men?
5764-299665-0019	 Can we say that he is mercy and cured forever?
5764-299665-0020	 Do we prove his goodness by showing that he has opened the earth and swallowed thousands of his helpless children, or that with the volcanoes he has overwhelmed them with rivers of fire?
5764-299665-0021	 Was their goodness, was their wisdom in this?

5764-299665-0023	 Most people cling to the supernatural.
5764-299665-0024	 If they give up one god, they imagine another.
5764-299665-0025	 What is this tower?
5764-299665-0026	 Man advances and necessarily advances to experience.
5764-299665-0027	 A man, wishing to go to a certain place, come to where the world divides.
5764-299665-0028	 He has tried that road and knows that it is the wrong road.
5764-299665-0029	 A child, shoun by the beauty of the flame, grafted with his dimpled hand.
5764-299665-0030	 The power that works for righteousness had taught the child a lesson.
5764-299665-0031	 It is a result.
5764-299665-0032	 It is insisted by the Theologians and by many of the so-called philosophers that this moral sense, this sense of duty of obligation was imported and that conscience is an exotic.
5764-299665-0033	 We live together in families, tribes and nations.
5764-299665-0034	 They are praised, admired and respected.
5764-299665-0035	 They are regarded as good that is to say as moral.
5764-299665-0036	 The members who add to the misery of the family, the tribe or the nation, are considered bad members.
5764-299665-0037	 The greatest of human beings had said conscience is born of love.
5764-299665-0038	 As people advance, the remote consequences are perceived.
5764-299665-0039	 The imagination is cultivated.
5764-299665-0040	 Um homem simtode uma idade da uma das площадas.
5764-299665-0041	 The sense of duty becomes stronger, more imperative.
5764-299665-0042	 Man judges himself.
5764-299665-0043	 In all this, there is nothing supernatural.
5764-299665-0044	 Man has deceived himself.
5764-299665-0045	 Has Christianity done good?
5764-299665-0046	 When the church had control, were men made better and happier?
5764-299665-0047	 What has religion done for Hungary or Austria?
5764-299665-0048	 Good these countries have been worth without religion.
5764-299665-0049	 Could they have been worse had they had any other religion than Christianity?
5764-299665-0050	 What did Christianity do for them?
5764-299665-0051	 They hate it, pressure.
5764-299665-0052	 They muffled all the bells of gladness.
5764-299665-0053	 The religion of the Puritan was an unadulterated curse.
5764-299665-0054	 the Puritan believed the Bible to be the Word of God. And this belief has always made those who held it cruel and wretched.
5764-299665-0055	 Let me refer to just one fact showing the influence of a belief in the Bible on human beings.
5764-299665-0056	 The Queen received the Bible, kissed it and pledged herself to diligently read Gering.

5764-299665-0058	 Has the bearable made the people of George Echai the merciful?
5764-299665-0059	 Religion has been tried and in all countries, in all times, dust failed.
5764-299665-0060	 Religion has always been the enemy of science, of investigation and thought.
5764-299665-0061	 Religion has never made men free.
5764-299665-0062	 He does never made man moral, temperate, industrious and honest.
5764-299665-0063	 Are Christians more temperate, near virtuous, near honest than savages?
5764-299665-0064	 Can we cure disease by supplication?
5764-299665-0065	 Can we receive virtue or honor as arms?
5764-299665-0066	 Religion rests on the idea that nature has a master, and that this master will listen to prayer, that this master punishes and rewards that he loves praise and flattery and hates the brave and free.
5764-299665-0067	 We must have cornerstones.
5764-299665-0068	 The structure must have a basement.
5764-299665-0069	 Kanske vi syker, kommertes vi begynn på bottom?
5764-299665-0070	 I have a theory and I have full core distance.
5764-299665-0071	 The first stone is that matter. Setions cannot be destroyed, cannot be annihilated.
5764-299665-0072	 If these cornerstones are facts, it follows as a necessity that matter and force are from end to eternity that they can neither be increased nor diminished.
5764-299665-0073	 It follows that nothing has been or can be created, that there never has been or can be a creator.
5764-299665-0074	 It follows that there could not have been any intelligence, any design back of matter and force.
5764-299665-0075	 I say what I think.
5764-299665-0076	 Every event has parents.
5764-299665-0077	 That, which has not happened, could not.
5764-299665-0078	 In the infinite changes and there can't be no broken, no missing link.
5764-299665-0079	 We now know that all first parents were not foreigners.
5764-299665-0080	 We now know if we know anything that the universe is natural and that men and women have been naturally produced.
5764-299665-0081	 We know the parts that life has traveled.
5764-299665-0082	 We know the footsteps of advance. They have been crazed.
5764-299665-0083	 For thousands of years, men and women have been crying to reform the world.
5764-299665-0084	 Why have the Reformers stayed?
5764-299665-0085	 Ils dépendent de la mort, de l'élection et de la charité.
5764-299665-0086	 They leave by fraud and violence and bequeath their vices to their children.
5764-299665-0087	 Failure seems to be the trademark of nature. Why?
5764-299665-0088	 Nature produces without purpose, sustains without intention, and destroys without thought.
5764-299665-0089	 Must the world forever remain the victim of ignorant passion?
5764-299665-0090	 Why should men and women have children that they cannot take care of? Children that are a burden and curses. Why?
5764-299665-0091	 Passion is and always has been death.
5764-299665-0092	 L'eau can punish, but it can neither reform criminals, nor prevent crime.
5764-299665-0093	 This cannot be done by talk or example.

5764-299665-0097	 It is far better to be free, to live the faults and barricades of fear, to stand erect and face the future with a smile.
6070-63485-0000	 They're done for, said the schoolmaster in a lowkey to the sweat, out with your vitreal and mind your eye.
6070-63485-0001	 The two monsters took off their shoes and moved stealthily along, keeping in the shadows of the houses.
6070-63485-0002	 By means of this stratagem, they followed so closely that, although within a few steps of Ceren, Tom, they did not hear them.
6070-63485-0003	 Sarah and her brother, having again passed by the Tubby Frank, arrived close to the dilapidated house, which was partly in ruins, and its open cellars formed a kind of gulf, along which the street ran in that direction.
6070-63485-0004	 In an instant, the schoolmaster, with a leap resembling in strength and agility the spring of a tiger, seized seat and with one hand by the throat, and exclaimed, your money, or I will fling you into this hole.
6070-63485-0005	 No, set the old broat, drumblingly. No, not wondering what a shame.
6070-63485-0006	 Tom Satan did not lose his presence of mine during this scene, rapidly and unexpectedly as it had occurred.
6070-63485-0007	 Oh, ah, to lay a trap to catch us, reply the thief.
6070-63485-0008	 Then, addressing Thomas Ceton, you know the plane of Saint Denis.
6070-63485-0009	 Did you see in the cabaret we had just left? For I know you again, the man whom the charcoal man came to seek.
6070-63485-0010	 Cried the schoolmaster a thousand francs and I'll kill him.
6070-63485-0011	 That child do not seek his life, replace Sarah to the schoolmaster.
6070-63485-0012	 Let's go and meet him
6070-63485-0013	 All by you, it will pay for looking after her.
6070-63485-0014	 Well, my wife shall be there, set the schoolmaster. You will tell her what you want, and I shall see.
6070-63485-0015	 in the plane of Saint Denis.
6070-63485-0016	 Between St. Watt and the road of Lara Valt at the end of the road? Agreed.
6070-63485-0017	 He had forgotten the address of the self-styled pan painter.
6070-63485-0018	 The fiat has started.
6070-86744-0000	 France, who seemed attracted by some invisible influence towards the count, in which terror was strangely mingled, felt an extreme reluctance to permit his friend to be exposed alone to the singular fascination that this mysterious personage seemed to exercise over him, and therefore made no objection to Arbets' request, but at once accompanied him to the desired spot, and, after a short delay, the count joined them in the salon.
6070-86744-0001	 My very good friend, an excellent neighbour replied the count with a smile. You really exaggerate my trifling exertions.
6070-86744-0002	 My father, the Kondomossev, although of Spanish origin, possesses considerable influence both at the court of France and Madrid, and I unhesitatingly place the best services of myself and all to whom my life is dear at your disposal.
6070-86744-0003	 I can scarcely credit it.
6070-86744-0004	 Then it is settled, said the Count. And I give you my solemn assurance that I only waited an opportunity like the present to realise plans that I have long meditated.
6070-86744-0005	 Show me a positive appointment for a particular day and hour in quiet the count. Only let me warn you that I am proverbial for my punctilious exactitude in keeping my engagements. Day for day, hour for hour said Albert. That will suit me to a dot.
6070-86744-0006	 So be it then replied the counts, and extending his hand towards a calendar suspended near the chimney-piece, he said, today is the 21st of February, and drawing out his watch I did. It is exactly half past ten o'clock. Now promise me to remember this, and expect me the 21st of May, at the same hour in the according to the calendar.
6070-86744-0007	 I reside in my father's house, but occupy a pavilion at the father's side of the courtyard, and tile is separated from the main building.
6070-86744-0008	 Now then, set the count, returning his tablets to his pocket. Make yourself perfectly easy. The hand of your timepiece will not be more accurate in marking the time than myself.
6070-86744-0009	 That depends when do you leave?
6070-86744-0010	 For France, no for Venice, I shall remain in Italy for another year or two.
6070-86744-0011	 Then we shall not meet in Paris.
6070-86744-0012	 I fear I shall not have that honor.
6070-86744-0013	 Well, since Wommest Park said the count, holding out a hand to each of the young men, allow me to wish you both a safe and pleasant journey.
6070-86744-0014	 What is the matter asked Albert of France when they had returned to their own apartments? You seem more than commonly thoughtful.
6070-86744-0015	 I will confess to you all that replied France. The count is a very singular person, and the appointment you have made to meet him in Paris fills me with a thousand apprehensions.
6070-86744-0016	 Did you ever meet him previously to coming hither?
6070-86744-0017	 Upon my honour, then listen to me.
6070-86744-0018	 He dwelt with considerable force and energy on the almost magical hospitality he had received from the count, and the magnificence of his entertainment in the throttle of the thousand and one night. He recounted with circumstantial exactitude all the particulars of the supper, the hashish, the statues, the dream, and how, at his awakening, there remained no proof or trace of all these events, saved the small yurt, seen in the distant horizon driving under full sail to home, do he?
6070-86744-0019	 Then he detailed the conversation overheard by him at the Coliseum between the Count and Vampire, in which the Count had promised to obtain the release of the Bandit Papino, an engagement which, as our readers are aware, he most faithfully fulfilled.
6070-86744-0020	 But set fancy the Corsican bandits that were among the crew of his vessel.
6070-86744-0021	 Why really the thing seems to me simple enough?
6070-86744-0022	 Talking of countries replied France of what countries the count, what is his native tongue? Whenst as he derived his immense fortune, and what were those events of his early life? A life as marvelous as unknown, that have tinsured his succeeding years with so dark and gloomy amizanthropy.
6070-86744-0023	 Certainly these are questions that in your place I should like to have answered.
6070-86744-0024	 My dear France replied Albert. When upon receipt of my letter, you found the necessity of asking the count's assistance, you promptly went to him, saying, my friend Albert, the more self is in danger, helped me to deliver him.
6070-86744-0025	 What are his means of existence? What is his birthplace? Of what countries he and native?
6070-86744-0026	 I confess he asked me none. No, he merely came and freed me from the hands of Senior Vampa, where I can assure you, in spite of all my outward appearance of ease and in concern, I did not very particularly care to remain.
6070-86744-0027	 And this time it must be confessed to that, contrary to the usual state of affairs in discussions between the young men, the effective arguments were all on Albert's side.
6070-86744-0028	 Well, said France with a sigh, do as you please my dear viscount, for your arguments are beyond my powers of refutation.
6070-86744-0029	 And now my dear friends, let us talk of something else.
6070-86745-0000	 Then, should anything appear to merit a more minute examination, Albert de Morsef could follow up his researchers by means of a small gate, similar to that close to the concierge store, and which merits a particular description.
6070-86745-0001	 shrubs and creeping plants covered the windows, and hid from the garden and caught these two apartments, the only rooms into which, as they were on the ground floor, the prying eyes of the curious could penetrate.
6070-86745-0002	 At a quarter to ten a valid entered. He composed with a little room named John, and who only spoke English, all Albert's establishment, although the cook of the hotel was always at his service, and on great occasions the cows shatter also.
6070-86745-0003	 Wait, then during the day, tell Rosa that when I leave the opera I will suck with her as she wishes.
6070-86745-0004	 Very well at half past ten.
6070-86745-0005	 Is the count us up yet?
6070-86745-0006	 There's a lail left the room.
6070-86745-0007	 Good morning Lucian, good morning, said Albert, your punctuality really alarms me.
6070-86745-0008	 You whom I expected last, you arrive at 5 minutes to 10, when the time fixed was half past.
6070-86745-0009	 No no my dear fellow do not come found our plans.
6070-86745-0010	 Yes, he has not much to complain of. Bush is the capital of Charles VII.
6070-86745-0011	 It is for that reason you see me so early.
6070-86745-0012	 I returned home at daybreak and strove to sleep, but my head ached and I got up to have a ride for an hour.
6070-86745-0013	 Pests, I will do nothing of the kind. The moment they come from Godendment, you would find them acceptable.
6070-86745-0014	 Besides, that does not concern the home but the financial department.
6070-86745-0015	 about what about the papers?
6070-86745-0016	 in the entire political world of which you are one of the leaders.
6070-86745-0017	 They say that it is quite fair and that sowing so much red you ought to reap a little blue.
6070-86745-0018	 Come, come, that is not bad said Lucia.
6070-86745-0019	 With your talents, you would make your fortune in three or four years.
6128-63240-0000	 The gentleman had not even needed to sit down to become interested. Apparently he had taken up the volume from a table as soon as he came in and standing there after a single glance around the apartment had lost himself in his pages.
6128-63240-0001	 "'That has an unflattering sound for me,' said the young man.
6128-63240-0002	 She is willing to risk that.
6128-63240-0003	 Just as I am, the visitor inquired, presenting himself with rather a work-a-day aspect.
6128-63240-0004	 He was tall and lean and dressed throughout in black. His shirt collar was low and wide and the triangle of linen, a little crampalled, exhibited by the opening of his waistcoat, was adorned by a pin containing a small red stone.
6128-63240-0005	 In spite of this decoration, the young man looked poor. Is poor as a young man could look who had such a fine hair and such magnificent eyes.
6128-63240-0006	 Those of Basil Ransom were dark, deep and glowing. His head had a character of elevation which fairly added to his statue. It was a head to be seen above the level of the crowd, on some judicial bench or political platform, or even on a bronze medal.
6128-63240-0007	 These things, the eyes especially, with their smordering fire, might have indicated that he was to be a great American statesman. Or, on the other hand, they might simply have proved that he came from Carolina or Alabama.
6128-63240-0008	 And yet the reader, who likes a complete image, who desires to read with the senses as well as with the reason, is entreated not to forget that he prolonged his consonants and swallowed his vowels. That he was guilty of allegiance and interpolations, which were equally unexpected, and that his discourse was pivaded by something sultry and vast. Something almost African in its rich, basking tone. Something that suggested the teaming expanse of the cotton field.
6128-63240-0009	 And he took up his hat vaguely, a soft black hat with a low crown and an immense straight brim.
6128-63240-0010	 Well, so it is. There are all witches and wizards, mediums and spirit wrappers, and rowing radicals.
6128-63240-0011	 If you are going to dine with her, you had better know it. Oh, murder.
6128-63240-0012	 Elected Mrs. Nui Na with intelligent incredulity
6128-63240-0013	 She was attractive and impertinent, especially the latter.
6128-63240-0014	 Have you been in Europe?
6128-63240-0015	 No, I haven't been anywhere.
6128-63240-0016	 She hates it. She would like to abolish it.
6128-63240-0017	 This last remark, he made at a venture, for he earned naturally not devoted any suposition whatever to Mrs. Lina.
6128-63240-0018	 Are you very ambitious? You look as if you were.
6128-63240-0019	 And Mrs. Lena added that now she was back, she didn't know what she should do.
6128-63240-0020	 One didn't even know what one had come back for.
6128-63240-0021	 Besides, I lived in one her in Boston and didn't go through the form of saying so.
6128-63240-0022	 That was one comfort without leave. She never went through any forms.
6128-63240-0023	 She stood there, looking, consciously and rather seriously and Mr. Ransom. A smile of exceeding faintness played about her lips. It was just perceptible enough to light up the native gravity of her face.
6128-63240-0024	 Her voice was low and agreeable, a cultivated voice, and she extended the slender white hand to her visitor, her remarked with some solemnity. He felt a certain guilt of participation in Mrs. Luna's indiscretion, that he was intensely happy to make her acquaintance.
6128-63240-0025	 He observed that Miss Chancellus Han was at once called in limp. She merely placed it in his, without exerting the smallest pressure.
6128-63240-0026	 A shall be back very late, we're going to do a theatre party. That's why we're done so early.
6128-63240-0027	 Mrs. Luney's familiarity extended even to her sister. She remarked to Miss Chan's that she looked as if she got up for a sea voyage.
6128-63241-0000	 Paul Ransom announced this fact to himself as if he had made a great discovery. But in reality, he had never been so be-ocean as a back moment.
6128-63241-0001	 The women he had hitherto known had been mainly of his own soft climb, and it was not often the exhibited detainency he detected, and cursory deplored in Mrs. Luna's sister.
6128-63241-0002	 Ransom was pleased with the vision of that remedy. It must be repeated that he was very provincial.
6128-63241-0003	 He was sorry for her, but he saw in a flash that no one could help her. That was what made her tragic.
6128-63241-0004	 She could not defend herself against the rich admiration, a kind of tenderness of envy, of anyone who had been so happy as to have that opportunity.
6128-63241-0005	 His family was ruined. They had lost their slaves, their property, their friends and relations, their home, had tasted of all the cruelty of defeat.
6128-63241-0006	 The state of Mississippi sinned to him the state of despair, so he surrendered the remnants of his patrimony to his mother and sisters and at nearly 30 years of age, elated for the first time in New York in the costume of his province with $50 in his pocket and an aring hunger in his heart.
6128-63241-0007	 It was in the female line as Baelzell ran some headwritten, in answering her letter with a good deal of form and flourish. His spook as if they had been royal houses.
6128-63241-0008	 If it had been possible to send Mrs. Ransom money or even close, she would have liked that, but she had no means of ascertaining how such an offering would be taken.
6128-63241-0009	 Mae g會 bir o fferad dr норм, dar gycha techno nhw.
6128-63241-0010	 She had erected it into a sort of rule of conduct that whenever she saw a risk she was to take it. And she had frequent humiliations at finding herself safe after all.
6128-63241-0011	 She was perfectly safe after writing to Basil Ransom, and indeed it was difficult to see what he could have done to her except thank her. He was only exceptionally superlative for her letter, and assure her that he would come and see her the first time his business. He was beginning to get a little, should take him to Boston.
6128-63241-0012	 He was too simple, too misdiscipline for that. She was almost disappointed.
6128-63241-0013	 Of all things in the world, contention was most sweet to her. The why it is hard to imagine, who had always cost her tears, headaches, a deal to be so in bad, acute emotion, and it was very possible Bayzer ransom would not care to
6128-63244-0000	 Miss Chancellor herself affords so much on the vital subject. Would not she make a few remarks and give them some of her experiences?
6128-63244-0001	 How did the ladies and beacons treat feel about the ballot?
6128-63244-0002	 Perhaps she could speak for them, more than for some others.
6128-63244-0003	 With her men's sympathy for reform, she found herself so often wishing that reformers were a little different.
6128-63244-0004	 I'd have hated to hear that fine avenue talk about as if it was such a remarkable place and to live there were a proof of worldly glory.
6128-63244-0005	 All sorts of inferior people lived there, and subrillion to women as Mrs. Spamender, who lived at Blacksbury, ought to not to mix things up.
6128-63244-0006	 She knew her place in the Boston hierarchy and it was not what Mrs. Van Indus supposed. So that there was a wonder of perspective in talking to her as if she had been a representative of the aristocracy.
6128-63244-0007	 She wished to work in another field. She had long been preoccupied with the romance of the people.
6128-63244-0008	 This might seem one of the most accessible of pleasures, but in point of fact, she had not found its soul.
6128-63244-0009	 Charlie was a young man in a wide overcoat and a paper collar. It was for him in the last of nicest that the cared match the most.
6128-63244-0010	 On a Chancellor wondered how Mrs Dinder would treat their branch of the question.
6128-63244-0011	 If it be necessary, we are prepared to take certain steps to conciliate the shrinking.
6128-63244-0012	 Our movement is for all. It will be also the most delicate ladies.
6128-63244-0013	 Raise the standard among them and bring me your thousand names.
6128-63244-0014	 and look after the details as well as the book currents. Mrs. Faminder added, in a tone as explanatory as could be expected of such a woman, and with a smile of which the sweetness was thrilling to her listener.
6128-63244-0015	 said, O'Leif Chancellor, with a face which seemed to plead for a remission of responsibility.
6128-63244-0016	 I want to be near to them to help them.
6128-63244-0017	 It was one thing to choose for herself, but now the great representative of the infant husband of the sex from every firm of bandage had chosen for her.
6128-63244-0018	 The unhappiness of women.
6128-63244-0019	 They were her sisters, they were her own, and the day of their delivery had dawned.
6128-63244-0020	 This was the only sacred cause. This was the great, the dust of a relation. It was time. It was so bad everything before it. It must exact from the other, the brutal bloodstained, ravening race, the last particle of expiation.
6128-63244-0021	 There would be names of women weak, insulted, persecuted, but devoted in every part of their being to the cause and asking no better fate than to die for it.
6128-63244-0022	 It was not clear to this interesting girl in what manner such a sacrifice of this last would be required of her, that she sold a matter through a kind of sunrise mist of a nation, which made danger as Rosie is success.
6128-63244-0023	 When Miss Bird's eye approached, it transfigured her familiar, her comical shape and made the poor little humanitory hack seem already a martyr.
6128-63244-0024	 Olive Chancellor looked at her with love, remembered that she had never in her long and rewarded rare real life, had a thought on impulse for herself.
6128-63244-0025	 She had been consumed by the passion of sympathy. It had crumbled her into as many creases as an old glazed, distended glove.
6432-63722-0000	 But excuse me, Daniel Fagandorne, some detectives and given up fishing.
6432-63722-0001	 and Shag, with the freedom of an old servant, stood looking at his mastery as if not quite understanding the new twist the affairs had taken.
6432-63722-0002	 I'm going off fishing. I may not catch anything and may not want to after I get there.
6432-63722-0003	 Get ready, Shag. Yes, Colonel.
6432-63722-0004	 and, having put himself in a fair way, as he'd hoped, to solve some of the problems connected with the Darcy case. Colonel Ashley went down to police headquarters to learn more facts in the connection with the murder of a East Indian.
6432-63722-0005	 Pick us in Donovan, haven't they, Carol? Yep.
6432-63722-0006	 Carol was too much engaged in watching the blue smoke curl lazily upward from its gargist end the same or.
6432-63722-0007	 Are you going to work on that case kernel?
6432-63722-0008	 But he hadn't any more to do with it Colonel than that cat.
6432-63722-0009	 Perhaps not admitted colonel Ashley.
6432-63722-0010	 We've got our man and that's all we want.
6432-63722-0011	 You're on the Darcy case, they tell me. In a way, yes.
6432-63722-0012	 I'm working in the interest of the young man.
6432-63722-0013	 It's just one of them coincidence as like.
6432-63722-0014	 Mustard is head in with a heavy candle stick. Want to prepare.
6432-63722-0015	 God explain the Colonel.
6432-63722-0016	 The very pair I was going to buy.
6432-63722-0017	 Look here, Colonel. Do you know anything about this?
6432-63722-0018	 and the detective's professional instincts got the upper hand of his friendliness. Not the least in the world, not as much as you do, was the cool answer.
6432-63722-0019	 I happen to see those candles sticks in the window of single-fudge shop the other day and I made up my mind to buy them when I had a chance
6432-63722-0020	 Now I'm afraid I won't, but how did it happen?
6432-63722-0021	 I don't know whether that's his first or his last name. Anyhow, he had a partner named Cheryl E.
6432-63722-0022	 Anyhow, he infested and get along very well with James.
6432-63722-0023	 Neighbors often hurt them scrapping a lot. In this afternoon they went at it again at Hawton Heavy.
6432-63722-0024	 toward dark a man went into by a lamp.
6432-63722-0025	 He found the place without a light in it, stumbled over something on the floor, and there was Ali's body. Where they had busted in in this heavy candle stick near it.
6432-63722-0026	 Sure, held so tight we could hard to get it out.
6432-63722-0027	 Maybe the fight was about who owned the watch. For the daggers talked in their foreign lingo and none of the neighbors could tell what they were saying. Hi, see.
6432-63722-0028	 and the watch, have you it? Yes, it's here.
6432-63722-0029	 That's the watch, announced the headquarters detective reaching in for it. Going at, see?
6432-63722-0030	 You're not a screen mishas all that are you just because it was in a dead man's hands and a woman's
6432-63722-0031	 and Donovan's voice was plainly skeptical.
6432-63722-0032	 Yes, it may have some rough edges on it.
6432-63722-0033	 and I've read enough about germs and no the danger. I'd advise you to be careful.
6432-63722-0034	 If you don't mind, I should like to examine this a bit.
6432-63722-0035	 before the big wind and iron suggested thong with a nod of desireous compatriot. Slightly, they'll have the kernel.
6432-63722-0036	 That's right, agreed the Colonel, as he continued to move his magnifying glass over the surface of the still ticking watch.
6432-63722-0037	 In a close observer might have observed that he did not touch his bare fingers to the timepiece, but poked it about and touched it here and there with the end of a lead pencil.
6432-63722-0038	 and Donovan, take a friend's advice and don't be too free with that watch. Too free with it.
6432-63722-0039	 Has the surprise detective? Yes.
6432-63722-0040	 Don't scratch yourself on it, whatever you do. Why not?
6432-63722-0041	 Simply because this watch...
6432-63722-0042	 Someone out here to see you.
6432-63722-0043	 Alright, be there in a second.
6432-63722-0044	 Xing De Fu was the painting answer.
6432-63722-0045	 I want to talk over Darcy's case with you, the Colonel had said, and the two had talked, had thought, had talked again, and now we're silent for a time.
6432-63722-0046	 What are the charges of getting him off legally if we go out from a negative standpoint? Ask the Colonel.
6432-63722-0047	 Rather a hypothetical question, Colonel, but I should say it might be a 50-50 proposition.
6432-63722-0048	 At best, he would get off with a scotch verdict of not proven, but he doesn't want that. Nor do I.
6432-63722-0049	 And you, I don't want to be there.
6432-63722-0050	 But I want to know just where we stand. Now I know.
6432-63722-0051	 But I need to do a little more smoking out first. Now I want to think.
6432-63722-0052	 If you'll excuse me, I'll pretend I'm fishing and I may catch something.
6432-63722-0053	 In fact, I have a feeling that I will land my fish.
6432-63722-0054	 I'd recommend him to you instead of Blackstone. Thanks, Laptkeness.
6432-63722-0055	 What is it? Perhaps I can help you.
6432-63722-0056	 The old adage of two heads, you know?
6432-63722-0057	 Yes, it still holds good.
6432-63722-0058	 No Alimony replied the Colonel puzzled. Yes, just that.
6432-63722-0059	 And there's no reason you shouldn't know.
6432-63723-0000	 chuckled the Colonel, as he scoffily played the luckless trout, now struggling to get loose from the hook.
6432-63723-0001	 And when the fish was landed, panting on the grass and Shag had been roused from his slumber to slip and now limp fish into the creel, Colonel Ashley gave a sigh of relief and remark. I think I see it now.
6432-63723-0002	 The reason she asks no Alimony and Quard Kenneth?
6432-63723-0003	 No, I wasn't thinking of that.
6432-63723-0004	 However, don't think I'm not interested in your case. I've finished enough for today.
6432-63723-0005	 Well, I don't know that you can.
6432-63723-0006	 It isn't generally known when on the lawyer that the hotel keeper's wife has left him.
6432-63723-0007	 It was one of what at first might be called Refined Cruelty on her husband's part, de-generating gradually into that of a baser sword.
6432-63723-0008	 You don't mean that large strucker that there was physical abuse to you as the Colonel. That's what he did.
6432-63723-0009	 The Colonel did not disclose the fact that there was no news to him.
6432-63723-0010	 Aaron Grafton's statement was being unexpectedly confirmed.
6432-63723-0011	 He remembered that Cynthia and Grafton had once been in love with each other.
6432-63723-0012	 She said he had struck her more than once, and she could stand no longer.
6432-63723-0013	 because large made no defense.
6432-63723-0014	 Large, by refusing to appear, practically admitted the charges against him and did not oppose the separation.
6432-63723-0015	 So I had to let her have her way and we did not ask the court for money. Though I had no such squeamish feelings when it came to my council fee.
6432-63723-0016	 No, but he will. Or I'll sue him and get judgment. Oh, he'll pay all right.
6432-63723-0017	 and it takes all sorts of persons to make it up.
6432-63723-0018	 Still, I would like to know.
6432-63723-0019	 The murder of Mrs. Darcy had, some time ago, been shifted off the front page. Though it would get back there when the young jeweler was tried.
6432-63723-0020	 It had a double reputation, so to speak.
6432-63723-0021	 Grave and even Reverend, the convention assembled in its ballroom and politicians of the upper, if not better class, were frequently seen in its dining room or cafe.
6432-63723-0022	 Large himself was a peculiar character.
6432-63723-0023	 In a smaller place he would have been called a saloon keeper.
6432-63723-0024	 And it was this man, Richard, who said, handsome certainly, that Cynthia Ratchford had married.
6432-63723-0025	 To this was the answer, whispered, Money.
6432-63723-0026	 and in a way it was true.
6432-63723-0027	 She also saw an opportunity of paying old debts and reaping some revinches.
6432-63723-0028	 After the marriage, which was a brilliant and gay one, if not happy, the large hotel, it could hardly be called home, became the scene of many festifications.
6432-63723-0029	 Then it was said of large that, soon after the echoes of the wedding chimes had died away, he had begun to treat his wife for the refined cruelty. That hidden away from the public, underneath his habitual manner, there was the rawness of the brute.
6432-63723-0030	 But it was noticed that the older and more conservative families were less often represented. And when they were, it was by some of the younger members, whose reputations were already smirched or who had not yet acquired any, and were willing to take a chance.
6432-63723-0031	 It wouldn't do, you know. After that story came out for me in the vice chancellor who sat in the case As well as other judges and members of the bar to be seen there. Can I explain to the colonel?
6432-63723-0032	 Meanwhile, Colonel Ashley was a very busy man. And to no one did he tell very much about his activities. He saw Darcy frequently at the jail, and to that young man's pleading that something'd be done, always returned the answer.
6432-63723-0033	 Don't worry, it will come out alright.
6432-63723-0034	 I'm going to rectify them, but it will take time.
6432-63723-0035	 It's hard for Miss Mason too, although she's bearing up like a major.
6432-63723-0036	 So, King God, Bale, who put it up?
6432-63723-0037	 It was time. LARCH.
6432-63723-0038	 They took Harry away a while ago.
6432-63723-0039	 But his are pretty uncertain shoes to be in just the same.
6432-63723-0040	 Only that I Darcy hesitated and grew red
6432-63723-0041	 Good evening, Colonel. He called G. Ely. Will you join me in a Welsh rabbit?
6432-63723-0042	 Thank you. No.
6432-63723-0043	 I'm afraid my dad's just and isn't quite up to that as I've had to cut out my fishing of late.
6432-63723-0044	 Now as to certain matters in the store on the morning of the murder.
6432-63723-0045	 The stopped clocks for instance. Have you any theory?
6432-63723-0046	 There were three of them, the center figure being that of Harry King, and he was very much intoxicated.
6432-63723-0047	 That is not always, but sometimes it happened to be so now.
6432-63723-0048	 Hi Baggy pardon, he said. In the cultured tones, he knows so well how to use. Yet of what he made so little use of late.
6432-63723-0049	 I said, where have you been? Remark together. We've missed you.
6432-63723-0050	 I said I was golfing even on exceedingly distinctly, though with an effort.
6432-63723-0051	 Why plownies some on ask?
6432-63723-0052	 Because dear friend replied King softly, he somewhat resembles a certain person here who talks too much. But who is not so wise as he thinks.
6432-63723-0053	 There was a rattle of coins on the Mahogany Bar as King sought to disentangle a single bill from the watered up currency in his pocket.
6432-63723-0054	 It's it's an odd coin an old Roman one that Mrs. Darcy had in her private collection kept in the jewelry store safe Was the whispered answer
6432-63723-0055	 I went over them near the day and noticed some were missing, though I saw them all when I paid a visit to her just a short time before she was killed.
6432-63723-0056	 That was hers when on the door.
6432-63723-0057	 Now Harry King has an exclaimed Colonel Ashley.
6938-70848-0000	 Even the sun came out pale and watered noon.
6938-70848-0001	 the course and rheumatism of the reigning months vanished.
6938-70848-0002	 As to worker, last Sunday you did it when the young girls.
6938-70848-0003	 Well, didn't they shoot us? One man exhibited his arm in a sling.
6938-70848-0004	 Haven't I got something to remember them by the devils?
6938-70848-0005	 Who are you to destroy the legal government with learning a German?
6938-70848-0006	 Who are you, a counter-revolutionist, a provocator? They beloved at him.
6938-70848-0007	 You call yourself the people of Russia, but you are not the people of Russia.
6938-70848-0008	 The peasants are the people of Russia, wait until the peasants...
6938-70848-0009	 We know what the peasants will say, aren't they working man like ourselves?
6938-70848-0010	 This man especially welcomed the call to a Congress of peasants.
6938-70848-0011	 This last were the young generation who had been serving in the army.
6938-70848-0012	 whereupon the old executive committee left the hall.
6938-70848-0013	 Down with him they strict.
6938-70848-0014	 Fearful Tamil Christ down with the Paul Shaviki.
6938-70848-0015	 Upon my return I visited Mollney. No such accusation was made against me there. After a brief conversation I left and that's all. Let anyone present make such an accusation.
6938-70848-0016	 Meanwhile, the question of the status of the Executive Committee was agitating all minds.
6938-70848-0017	 By declaring the Assembly extraordinary conference, it had been planned to block the re-election of the Executive Committee.
6938-70848-0018	 But this worked both ways. The last social revolutionist decided that if the Congress had no power over the executive committee, then the executive committee had no power over the Congress.
6938-70848-0019	 On the 27th occurred the debate on the land question, which revealed the differences between the Egririan program of the Bursheviki and the Left Socialist Revolutionaries.
6938-70848-0020	 The constituent assembly will not dare to break with the wheel of the people.
6938-70848-0021	 Follow Him, Lannin, listen to now with absorbing intensity.
6938-70848-0022	 The first stage was the crushing of autocracy and the crushing of the power of the industrial capitalists, and the landowners whose interests are closely related.
6938-70848-0023	 The tumest and jamstows were dropped.
6938-70848-0024	 He knew that an agreement with the Paul Chevyky was being discussed, but he did not know that it had been concluded.
6938-70848-0025	 He spoke to the Ram Convention.
6938-70848-0026	 The villages will save us in the end.
6938-70848-0027	 But the present movement is international and that is why it is invincible.
6938-70848-0028	 The wheel of millions of workers is now concentrated in the hall.
6938-70848-0029	 A new humanity will be born of this war.
6938-70848-0030	 I greet you with the questioning of a new Russian life and freedom.
7018-75788-0000	 Then I took up a great stone from among the trees and coming up to him, smote him there with on the head, with all my might and crushed in his skull as he lay dead drunk.
7018-75788-0001	 Behold, a ship was making for the island through the Dashin Sea and Clashing Waves.
7018-75788-0002	 Hearing this I was sore troubled remembering what I had before suffered from the ape kind.
7018-75788-0003	 Upon this he bought me a cotton bag and given it to me said, take this bag and fill it with pebbles from the beach, and go forth with the company of the town's folk, to whom I will give a charge respecting thee.
7018-75788-0004	 Do as they do and be like they shall gain what may further thy return voyage to thy native land.
7018-75788-0005	 Then he carried me to the beach where I filled my bag with pebbles large and small, and presently we saw a company of folk issue from the town. Each bear in a bag like mine filled with pebbles.
7018-75788-0006	 To these he committed me, commending me to their care and saying, this man is a stranger, so take him with you and teach him how to gather, that he may get his daily bread, and you will earn your reward and recompense in heaven.
7018-75788-0007	 Now sleeping under these trees were many apes, which when they saw us rose and fled from us and swarmed up among the branches, where upon my companions began to pelt them with what they had in their bags, and the apes fell to plucking of the fruit of the trees and casting them at the folk.
7018-75788-0008	 We weighed anchor and Sharazard perceived the dawn of the day and ceased to say in her permitted say.
7018-75788-0009	 when it was the 559th night.
7018-75788-0010	 and ceased not sailing till we arrived safely at Busara.
7018-75788-0011	 There I aboad a little and then went on to Baghdad, where I entered my quarter and found my house and forgathered with my family and saluted my friends who gave me joy of my safe return. And I laid up all my goods and valuables in my storehouses.
7018-75788-0012	 After which I returned to my old merry way of life and forgot all I had suffered in the great prophet and gain I had made.
7018-75788-0013	 Next morning, as soon as it was light, he prayed the dawn prayer, and, after blessing Muhammad the cream of all creatures, he took himself to the house of Sinbad the Seaman, and wished him a good day.
7018-75788-0014	 Here I found a great ship ready for sea and full of merchants and notables who had with them goods of price so I embarked my bales therein.
7018-75788-0015	 Happily amongst you is one righteous, whose prayers the Lord will accept.
7018-75788-0016	 Presently the ship struck the mountain and broke up, and all in everything on board of her were plunged into the sea.
7018-75788-0017	 but it burneth in their bellies, so they cast it up again, and it congealeth on the surface of the water, whereby its colour and quantities are changed. And at last, the waves cast it ashore, and the travellers and merchants who know it, collect it and sell it.
7018-75788-0018	 Each that died we washed and shrouded in some of the clothes and linen cast ashore by the tides. And after little the rest of my fellows perished, one by one. Till I had buried the last of the party and abode alone on the island. With but a little provision left, I who was want to have so much.
7018-75788-0019	 But there is majesty and there is no might save in Allah, the glorious, the great.
7018-75789-0000	 when it was the 561st night.
7018-75789-0001	 Then, signed for myself, I set to work collecting a number of pieces of Chinese and Cormorant alloys wood, and I bound them together with ropes from the wreckage. Then I chose out from the broken up ships straight planks of even size and fixed them firmly upon the alloys wood, making me a boat raft a little narrower than the channel of the stream. And I tied it tightly in firmly as though it were nailed.
7018-75789-0002	 Land after land shall thou seek and find, but no other life on thy wish shall wait. Fred not thy soul and thy thoughts are night, all woes shall land or sooner or late.
7018-75789-0003	 I rode my conveyance into the place which was intensely dark and the current carried me the raft with it down the underground channel.
7018-75789-0004	 And I threw myself down upon my face on the raft, by reason of the narrowness of the channel, whilst the streams ceased not to carry me along, knowing not night from day, for the excess of the gloom which encompassed me, about in my terror and concern for myself less I should perish.
7018-75789-0005	 When I awoke at last, I found myself in the light of heaven, and opening my eyes I saw myself in a broad stream, and the raft mowed to an island in the midst of a number of Indians and Abyssinians.
7018-75789-0006	 But I was delighted at my escape from the river.
7018-75789-0007	 When they saw I understood them not and made them no answer, one of them came forward and said to me an Arabic Peace be with thee, O my brother
7018-75789-0008	 On my brother answered he, We are husbandmen and tillers of the soil, Who came out to water our fields and plantations, And finding the asleep on this raft, Late hold of it, and made it fast by us, Against thou shuddest awake at thy leisure.
7018-75789-0009	 I answered, for Allah's sake, and my Lord, air I speak give me somewhat to eat, for I am starving, and after ask me what they willed.
7018-75789-0010	 when it was the 560 second night.
7018-75789-0011	 She said it hath reached me, our spacious king, that Sinbad the Seaman continued. When our landed and found myself amongst the Indians and Abesinians, and had taken some rest, they consulted among themselves and said to one another. There is no help for it, but we carry him with us and present him to our king, that he may acquaint him with his adventures.
7018-75789-0012	 So I can sort it with the chief of the islanders and they paid me the utmost respect.
7018-75789-0013	 So I rose without stay or delay and kissed the king's hand and acquainted him with my longing, to set out with the merchants. For that I pined after my people and my known land.
7018-75789-0014	 Quotty, thou art thine own master. Yet, if it be thy will to abide with us, on our head and eyes be it, for thou gladdenest us with thy company.
7018-75789-0015	 By Allah, my Lord, answered I. Thou hast indeed overwhelmed me with thy favours and well-doings. But I weary for a sight of my friends and family in native country.
7018-75789-0016	 Then I took leave of him, and of all my intimates and acquaintances in the island, and embarked with the merchants after said.
7018-75789-0017	 He asked me once they came and I said to him, by Allah, a commander of the faithful, I know not the name of the city, nor the way to the.
7018-75789-0018	 For state processions are thrown as set for him upon a huge elephant, a leavencuber tie, and upon this he sit at having his great lords and officers and guests standing in two ranks, on his right hand and on his left.
7018-75789-0019	 His letter has shown me this, and as for the mightiness of his dominion, though has told us what there has diwitnessed.
7018-75789-0020	 Presently, my friends came to me and I distributed presents among my family and gave arms and large s, after which I yielded myself to joy and enjoyment, moth and merry-making, and forgot all that I had suffered.
7018-75789-0021	 Such then, O my brothers, is the history of what befell me in my sixth voyage. And tomorrow, in Shalah.
7018-75789-0022	 I will tell you the story of my seventh and last voyage, which is still more wondrous and marvellous than that of the first six.
7018-75789-0023	 when it was the 563rd night.
7018-75789-0024	 She said it had reached me, O'er, spacious king, that when Sinbad the Seaman had related the history of what befell him in his sixth voyage, and all the company had dispersed, Sinbad the Landsman went home and slept as I want.
7018-75789-0025	 The seventh voyage of Sinbad the Seaman.
7018-75789-0026	 No, O company, that after my return from my sixth voyage, which brought me abundant profit, I resumed my formal life and all possible joints and enjoyment and mirth, and making merry day and night. And I carried some time in this solace and satisfaction, till my soul began once more too long to sail the seas and see foreign countries and company with merchants and he and you things.
7018-75789-0027	 So having made up my mind I packed up in bales a quantity of precious stuff suited for sea trade and repaired with them from Baghdad city to Basra town where I found a ship ready for sea. And in her are company of considerable merchants.
7018-75789-0028	 But the captain arose and Titan in his girdle tucked up his skirts, and after taking refuge with Allah from Satan the stone, climbed to the masthead. When he looked out right and left and gazed at the passengers and crew, fell to buff it in his face and plucking out his beard.
7018-75789-0029	 This he set an assoursor wetted with a little water, and after waiting a short time, smelt and tasted it. And then he took out of the chest a booklet wherein he read a while and said weeping, �No, O ye passengers, that in this book is a marvelous matter. To note in that who so come to that shall surely die, without hope of escape, for the disocean is called the sea of the climb of the king. Herein is a sepulchre of our Lord Solomon, son of David, on both be peace�
7018-75789-0030	 A second fish, rated's appearance, and which we had seen not more monstrous.
7018-75789-0031	 When suddenly a violent squall of wind arose and smote the ship, which rose out of the water and settled upon a great reef, the haunt of sea monsters, where it broke up and fell a sunder into planks, and all and everything on board were plunged into the sea.
7105-2330-0000	 Unfortunately, there could be no doubt or misconception as the platter baths guilt.
7105-2330-0001	 He had not only pleaded guilty, but had expressed his intention of repeating his escapeeid in other directions as soon as circumstances permitted. Throughout the trial, he was busy examining a small model of the free trade hall in Manchester.
7105-2330-0002	 The jury could not possibly find that the prisoner had not deliberately and intentionally blown up. The Albert Hall. The question was, could they find any extenuating circumstances which would permit a finiquittle?
7105-2330-0003	 Of course, any sentence which the law might feel compelled to inflict would be followed by an immediate pardon. But it was highly desirable from the government's point of view. That, the necessity for such an exercise of clemency should not arise.
7105-2330-0004	 Ahead lang pardon, ondae'y vava bialexan, with threats of a heavy voting defection, if it were withheld or even delayed, would not necessarily be a surrender, but it would look like one.
7105-2330-0005	 Hence, they are tidy in the crowded court, and in the little groups gathered round the tape machines in Whitehall and Doning Street and other affected centers.
7105-2330-0006	 The jury returned from considering their verdict. There was a flatter, an excited murmur, a death-like hush.
7105-2330-0007	 The foreman delivered his message.
7105-2330-0008	 The jury find the prisoner guilty of blowing up the Albert Hall.
7105-2330-0009	 The jury wished to add a writer, drawing attention to the fact that a bi-election is spending in the Parliamentary Division of Nemesis on hand.
7105-2330-0010	 and may the Lord have mercy on the pole. A junior consul exclaimed irreverently.
7105-2330-0011	 1500 said the Prime Minister with a shudder. It's too horrible to think of.
7105-2330-0012	 Our majority last time was only a 2007.
7105-2330-0013	 730 amended the Prime Minister. We must avoid any appearance of precipitancy.
7105-2330-0014	 Not later than 730 then, said the Chief Organizer. I have promised the agent down there that he shall be able to display posters announcing platter bath is out, before the poll opens.
7105-2330-0015	 He said it was our only chance of getting a telegram. Red wrap is in tonight.
7105-2330-0016	 Despite the earlyness of the hour, a small crowd had gathered in the street outside, and the horrible menacing, treelon or refrain of the 1500 voting men, came in a steady monotonous chant.
7105-2330-0017	 He exclaimed, Won't Go?
7105-2330-0018	 He says he never has left prison without a brass band to play him out and he's not going to go without one now.
7105-2330-0019	 said the Prime Minister. We can hardly be supposed to supply our least prisoner with a brass band. How on earth could we defend it on the estimates?
7105-2330-0020	 Anyway, you won't go unless he has a band.
7105-2330-0021	 Pull open in 5 minutes.
7105-2330-0022	 Splatter buff out yet?
7105-2330-0023	 In Heaven's name why?
7105-2330-0024	 The Chief Organizer rang off.
7105-2330-0025	 This is not a moment for standing on dignity. He observed bluntly. Musicians must be supplied at once.
7105-2330-0026	 Can you get a strike permit as the organizer?
7105-2330-0027	 I'll try. Said the home secretary and went to the telephone.
7105-2330-0028	 8 o clock struck, the crowd outside chanted with an increasing volume of sound. We'll vote the other way.
7105-2330-0029	 At telegram was brought in.
7105-2330-0030	 It was from the central comedy rooms at Nemesis.
7105-2330-0031	 Without a band, he would not go, and they had no band.
7105-2330-0032	 1 Quarther, plus ten. Half past
7105-2330-0033	 Have you any banned instruments of an easy nature to play?
7105-2330-0034	 demanded the chief organizer of the prison governor. Drums, symbols, those sort of things.
7105-2330-0035	 The Warriors have a private band of their own, said the governor. But of course, I couldn't allow them and themselves.
7105-2330-0036	 Blend the Synth instruments, set the Chief Organizer.
7105-2330-0037	 The popular song of the moment replied the agitator after a moment's reflection.
7105-2330-0038	 It was a tune they had all heard hundreds of times. So, there was no difficulty in turning out a passable imitation of it. To the improvised trains of, I didn't want to do it. The prisoners trodforth to freedom.
7105-2330-0039	 The word of the song had reference. It was understood today incarcerating government and not to the destroyer of the Albert Hall.
7105-2330-0040	 This seat was lost after all by a narrow maturity.
7105-2330-0041	 The local trade unionists took offense at the fact of cabinet ministers having personally acted as strike breakers, and even the release of platterbuff failed to pacify them.
7105-2340-0000	 With that notorious failing of his, he was not a sort of person one wanted in one's house.
7105-2340-0001	 Well, the failing still exists, doesn't it? Said the husband. Or do you suppose a reform of character is entailed along with the estate?
7105-2340-0002	 Besides, since this is not part, his being rich will make a difference in the way people will look at his failing.
7105-2340-0003	 When a man is absolutely wealthy, not merely well to do, all suspicion of started motive natural disappears. The thing becomes merely a tiresome melody.
7105-2340-0004	 Wilfred Pigeon Code had suddenly become heir to his uncle, Sir Wilfred Pigeon Code on the death of his cousin, Major Wilfred Pigeon Code, who had succumbed to the after effects of Apollo accident.
7105-2340-0005	 A Wilfred Fijian Code had covered himself with honors in the course of Maldives campaigns, and the name Wilfred had been a bad pysmal weakness in the family ever since. When you heir to the family dignity and estates was a young man of about 5 and 20 who was known more by reputation than by person to a wide circle of cousins and kinsfolk.
7105-2340-0006	 and the reputation was an unpleasant one.
7105-2340-0007	 From his late school days onward, he had been possessed by an acute and obstinate form of kleptomania. He had the acquisitive instinct of the collector without any of the collector's discrimination.
7105-2340-0008	 The search usually produced a large and varied yield. This is funny, said Peter Pigeon Volta's wife, some half are after their conversation. Here is a telegram from Wilfred, saying, he is passing through here in his motor and would like to stop and pay as his respects.
7105-2340-0009	 Sign, Wilfred Pichin Code.
7105-2340-0010	 I suppose it's bringing a suppressant for the silver wedding? Good gracious!
7105-2340-0011	 The talk flitted nervously and hurriedly from one impersonal topic to another.
7105-2340-0012	 In the drawing room after dinner, their nervousness and awkwardness increased.
7105-2340-0013	 Oh, we haven't shown you the silver wedding presents. Said Mrs. Peter suddenly. As those struck by a brilliant idea for entertaining the guest. Here they all are.
7105-2340-0014	 Such nice useful gifts, a few duplicates of course.
7105-2340-0015	 7 cream jugs put in Peter
7105-2340-0016	 We feel that we must live on cream for the rest of our lives.
7105-2340-0017	 Of course, some of them can be changed.
7105-2340-0018	 I put it done by the Clarage Jug. Set Wilfred, BC with another object.
7105-2340-0019	 Vigilance was not completely crowned with a sense of victory.
7105-2340-0020	 After they had said goodnight to their visitor, Mrs. Peter expressed her conviction that he had taken something.
7105-2340-0021	 I want Earth Earth to know, said Peter. The mean pig hasn't brought us a present, and I'm hanged if he shall carry one off.
7105-2340-0022	 is the only thing to do.
7105-2340-0023	 Wilfred was late in coming down to breakfast and his manner showed plainly that something was amiss.
7105-2340-0024	 It's an unpleasant thing to have to say. He blurted out presently. But I'm afraid you must have a thief among your servants. Something's been taken out of my portmanteau.
7105-2340-0025	 It was a little present for my mother and myself for your silver wedding.
7105-2340-0026	 I should have given it to you last night after dinner, only it happened to be a clean jug, and you seemed annoyed at having so many duplicates, so I felt rather awkward about giving you another.
7105-2340-0027	 Thus, nature had been an orphan these many years.
7105-2340-0028	 Lady Ernestine, Pigeon Code, his mother, moved in circles which were entirely beyond their compass or ambitions and the sun would probably one day be an ambassador.
7105-2340-0029	 Haspan and wife looked blankly and desperately at one another.
7105-2340-0030	 It was Mrs. Peter who arrived first at an inspiration. How dreadful to think there are thieves in the house. We keep the drawing room locked up at night of course, but anything might be carried off while we are at breakfast.
7105-2340-0031	 She rose and went out hurriedly as though to assure herself that the drawing room was not being stripped of its silverware and returned a moment later bearing a cream jug in her hands.
7105-2340-0032	 The patient codes had turned paler than ever. Mrs. Peter had a final inspiration.
7105-2340-0033	 Peter dashed out of the room with glad relief. He had lived so long during the last few minutes that a golden wedding seemed within measurable distance.
7105-2340-0034	 Mrs. Peter turned to her guest with confidential kindness.
7105-2340-0035	 Peter's little weakness, a transcend the family. Good Lord!
7105-2340-0036	 Do you mean to say he's a kleptomania? Like cousin's nature?
7105-2340-0037	 Brave little woman, said bitter with a gasp of relief. I could never have done it.
7902-96591-0000	 I'm from the cutter lying off the coast.
7902-96591-0001	 Don't cry, he said. I was obliged to come.
7902-96591-0002	 And, and you have not found out anything, came in quick freight and tones.
7902-96591-0003	 I wish you would believe me that I am in as great trouble about it as you are.
7902-96591-0004	 that my father, Sir Risen Graham, has smuggled goods here.
7902-96591-0005	 He could not help it. He hates the smugglers. You shall not tell.
7902-96591-0006	 Pray, pray, say you will not. Archiv's silent.
7902-96591-0007	 Then, as Archie stood in the dark, literally a gasp with astonishment. Here the faint wrestling once more, and again all was silent.
7902-96591-0008	 He laughed, but it was a curious kind of laugh, full of exation, injured and more proper. As the Prince called our love of our own dignity, of which Archibald Raystroke and the full flush of his young belief in his importance as a British officer had a pretty good stock.
7902-96591-0009	 and all comes of dressing up in this stupid way like a rough fish or lad.
7902-96591-0010	 Cold water came on this idea directly, as you recalled the fact that the darkness was intense and Celia could not have seen him.
7902-96591-0011	 I'll soon show them that I am not going to be played with.
7902-96591-0012	 For it suddenly occurred to him that he was not only a prisoner, but a prisoner in the power of a very reckless set of people who would stop it nothing.
7902-96591-0013	 No, he thought to himself. I don't believe they would kill me, but they would knock me about.
7902-96591-0014	 The kick he had received was a foretaste of what he might expect, and after a little consideration he came to the conclusion that his duty was to escape and get back to the cutter as quickly as he could.
7902-96591-0015	 To do this, he must scheme lie hid till morning, then make for the nearest point, a signal for help. Unless the boat's crew were already searching for him. How to escape.
7902-96591-0016	 The window was barred, but he went to it and tried the bars one by one to find them all solidly fitted into the stone cell.
7902-96591-0017	 Next moment as he felt his way about his hand touched an old-fashioned marble mantel piece. Fireplace, chimney.
7902-96591-0018	 Yes, if other ways failed he could escape up the chimney.
7902-96591-0019	 No, that was too bad. He cannot do that.
7902-96591-0020	 Sympathy and pity for the dwellers and the hose were completely gone now, and he said his teeth fast and mentally called himself a weak idiot for ever thinking about such people.
7902-96591-0021	 a narrow table against the wall in two places.
7902-96591-0022	 He went and tried to force his head through, recalling as he did that where a person's head would go the rest of the body would pass.
7902-96591-0023	 But there was no chance for his body there at the head would not go first.
7902-96591-0024	 A fellow who was shut up and prisoned for life might do it, he said, but not in a case like this.
7902-96592-0000	 Sure you look around everywhere boy. Yes father, quite.
7902-96592-0001	 I'm going home to breakfast.
7902-96592-0002	 Shall I come to father no?
7902-96592-0003	 Stop here till Sir Rizdem comes down and tell him I'm very sorry that we should have cleared out last night Only a born fool saw Jerry and Andy's lobster boat coming into the cove and came running to say it was a party from the cutter Yes, father
7902-96592-0004	 Tell him not to be uneasy, it is alright and I'll have everything clear away tonight.
7902-96592-0005	 The dull sound of deporting steps and a low whistling sound coming down through the skylight window into the cabin where Archie Ray Stroke lay with his heavy eyelids pressed down by sleep.
7902-96592-0006	 What a queer dream he thought to himself.
7902-96592-0007	 But how queer from Mr. Goethe to be talking like that to Andrew Teal, the boy who helps the cook.
7902-96592-0008	 And why did Andy call Mr. Gurr Father?
7902-96592-0009	 There was an interval of thinking over this naughty question, during which the low whistling went on.
7902-96592-0010	 And I'm hungry too. Time out was up I suppose.
7902-96592-0011	 No, he was not dreaming, for he was looking out on the sea, over which a faint mist hung like wreaths of smoke.
7902-96592-0012	 What did they say? Falsalarm. Tell serviced and they would clear all away tonight. See if anything had been left about. Lobster boat.
7902-96592-0013	 Once out of that room he could ran, and by day like the smugglers dare not hunt him down.
7902-96592-0014	 Oh, those bars, he mentally exclaimed, and he was advancing towards them. Well, just as he drew near, there was a rustling noise under the window. A couple of hands seized the bars. There was a scratching of buttoes against stonework, and ram's face appeared to gaze into the room by intention, but into the astonished countenance of the young machitmen instead.
7902-96592-0015	 Room was the first to recover from his surprise.
7902-96592-0016	 Hello, he said who are you?
7902-96592-0017	 Go run it up in the door, I wish it had been last night by mistake.
7902-96592-0018	 I saw you last night in one of his boy-y was.

7902-96592-0024	 been playing the spy that's what you've been doing. Who locked you in?
7902-96592-0025	 Archie stepped back to the door listening, but there was not a sound.
7902-96592-0026	 He has gone to give the alarm to the prisoner and he looked excitedly around for a way of escape.
7902-96592-0027	 Nothing but the chimney presented itself.
7902-96592-0028	 A happy inspiration had come, and placing one hand upon his chest, he thrust in the other, gave a tug, and drew at his little curved dark. Glanced at the edge, ran to the window, and began to cut at one of the bars. Libre in vain.
7902-96592-0029	 He divided the paint and produced a few squeaks and grating sounds as he realized that the attempt was madness.
7902-96592-0030	 The result was not very satisfactory, but sufficiently so to make him essay the bar of the window once more, producing a grating, eerie selling sound, as he found that now he did make a little impression, so little though that the probability was if he kept on working well for 24 hours he would not get through.
7902-96592-0031	 But at the end of five minutes he stopped and thrust back the Durkin to its sheath.
7902-96592-0032	 No, I can't part with that. Ha ha ha, left the board giringly.
7902-96592-0033	 But no, yes, I'll give you a guinea if you will let me out.
7902-96592-0034	 Ginnies of the boy think I'll do it for Ginnie. Well then too
7902-96592-0035	 Be quick, there's a good fellow. I want to get away at once.
7902-96592-0036	 Not you, only a shame.
7902-96592-0037	 Why, your clothes don't fit you and your caps put on all skewer.
7902-96592-0038	 Never mind about that. Let me out of this place.
7902-96592-0039	 I told you a Fisherboy cried Archie impatiently, but trying not to offend his visitor who possessed the power of conferring freedom by speaking sharply.
7902-96592-0040	 Not you, look like a wild beast in a cage, like a monkey, you insulin.
7902-96592-0041	 Aren't you checked himself in the boy laughed?

7902-96592-0043	 you laughed and fleered at me when I was on the cutters deck.
7902-96592-0044	 I say, you do look like a Roman, just like a big monkey in a show.
7902-96592-0045	 Ram showed his white teeth as he burst out with a long low fit of laughter.
7902-96592-0046	 You were hopes and me he said.
7902-96592-0047	 Why, I could tie you up in a nut and he view off the cliff any day. What a game.

7902-96592-0049	 Once more will you come and let me out? No.
7902-96592-0050	 To his astonishment the board did not flinch, but thrust his own arms through, placing them about the middie's waist, clenching his hand behind and uttering a sharp whistle.
7902-96594-0000	 It's evening at Spirits last night, Mr. Gerr.

7975-280084-0009	 The mean time the street was getting uncomfortably hot.
7975-280084-0010	 Every time I saw anyone with a bead on me, I would drop off my horse and try to drive the shooter inside. But I could not see in every direction.

7975-280085-0004	 Finally, we administered to him an oath not to betray our wereabouts until we had time to make our escape. And he agreed not to.
7975-280085-0005	 No sooner, however, will see release than he made post-taste in the Mankato to announce our presence, and in a few minutes another posse was looking for us.
7975-280085-0006	 The whistle on the oil mill blew and we feared that it was a signal that had been agreed upon to alarm the town in case we were observed, but we were not molested.
7975-280085-0007	 He had to sleep with it, pill it on my breast. Jim being also crippled with a wound in his shoulder, and we could not get much sleep.

7975-280085-0013	 There's no use stopping to pick up a com right here, but we can't get him through the line. Just charge them and make it if we can.
7975-280085-0014	 I got up as a signal for the charge and we fired one volley.
7975-280085-0015	 One of the fellows in the outer line, not brave enough himself to join the volunteers who had come in to beat us out, was not disposed to believe in the surrender, and had his gun leveled on Bob in spite of the handkerchief which was waving as a flag of truth.
7975-280085-0016	 Sheriff Glysspin of WaterOne County who was taking Bob's pistol from him was also shouting to the fellow.
7975-280085-0017	 including those received in and on the way from Northfield I had 11 wounds.
7975-280085-0018	 And Sheriff Glyspin's order not to shoot was the beginning of the protectorate that Minnesota people established over us.
8131-117016-0000	 Captain Murdoch
8131-117016-0001	 but Mars Port hit flourished enough to kill it off.
8131-117016-0002	 Some of Mars laws dated from the time when law enforcement had been hampered by lack of men, rather than by the type of men.
8131-117016-0003	 The Stonewall Gang numbered perhaps 500.
8131-117016-0004	 Even dereliction failures had to eat. There were stories and shops throughout the district, which eaked out some kind of marginal living.
8131-117016-0005	 They were safe from protection racketeers there. None bothered to come so far out.
8131-117016-0006	 The shopkeepers and some of the less unfortunate people there had protested loud enough to reach clear back to earth.
8131-117016-0007	 Captain Murdoch was an unknown factor, and now was asking for more men.
8131-117016-0008	 The pressure was enough to get them for him.
8131-117016-0009	 Gordon reported for work with a sense of the bottom falling out, mixed with a vague relief.
8131-117016-0010	 I've got a free hand and we're going to run this the way we would on earth.
8131-117016-0011	 Your job is to protect the citizens here, and that means everyone not breaking the laws. Whether you feel like it or not, no graft.
8131-117016-0012	 The first man making a shake down will get the same treatment we're going to use on the stonewall boys You'll get double pay here and you can live on it
8131-117016-0013	 He picked out five of the men, including Gordon. You five will come with me.
8131-117016-0014	 The rest of you can team up any way you want tonight. Pick any route that's open. Ok men, let's go.
8131-117016-0015	 Bruce Gordon Grins slowly as he swung the stick, and Murdoch's eyes fell on him. Earthcup.
8131-117016-0016	 Two years Gordon admitted.
8131-117016-0017	 for a second Gordon cursed himself.
8131-117016-0018	 He began wondering about security then.
8131-117016-0019	 Nobody had tried to get in touch with him.
8131-117016-0020	 There was a crude lighting system here, put up by the citizens. At the front of each building a dim phosphor bulb glued, when darkness fell they would have nothing else to see by.
8131-117016-0021	 Moving in two groups of threes, it opposite sides of the street. They began their beat.
8131-117016-0022	 There was no chance to save the citizen who was dying from lack of air.
8131-117016-0023	 Gordon felt the solid pleasure of the finely-turned club in his hands.
8131-117016-0024	 Gorn's eyes popped at that.
8131-117016-0025	 He swallowed the sentiment. His own club was moving now.
8131-117016-0026	 The other four cops had come in reluctantly.
8131-117016-0027	 He brought him to the ground with a single blow across the kidneys.
8131-117016-0028	 They rounded up the men of the gang and one of the cops started off.
8131-117016-0029	 to find a phone and call the wagon.
8131-117016-0030	 We're not using wagons, Murdoch, totem. Line them up.
8131-117016-0031	 If they tried to run, they were hit from behind. If they stood still, they were clubbed carefully.
8131-117016-0032	 Murdock indicated one who stood with his shoulder shaking and tears running down his cheeks.
8131-117016-0033	 The captain's face was as sick as Gordon's felt.
8131-117016-0034	 I want the name of every man in the gang you can remember. He told the man.
8131-117016-0035	 Colonel, they killed me. I don't know.
8131-117016-0036	 Murdoch took his nod as evident enough and turned to the wretched tuffs.
8131-117016-0037	 If he should turn up dead, I'll know you boys are responsible, and I'll find you.
8131-117016-0038	 Trouble began brewing shortly after though.
8131-117016-0039	 Murdoch sent one of the men to pick up a second squad of six and then a third
8131-117016-0040	 And the third one Bruce Gordon spotted one of the men who'd been beaten before.
8131-117016-0041	 Get a stretcher and take him wherever he belongs he ordered.
8131-117016-0042	 But the captain stirred finally, sighing.
8131-117016-0043	 Now, the cops are giving me. We're covered, Gordon.
8131-117016-0044	 But the Stonewall gang is backing Wayne.
8131-117016-0045	 but it's going to be tough on them.
8131-117016-0046	 Bruce Gordon Grimmest. I've got a yellow ticket from security.
8131-117016-0047	 Murdock blinked. He dropped his ice slowly.
8131-117016-0048	 What makes you think Wayne will be reelected?
8131-117016-0049	 Nobody wants him except a gang of crooks and those in power.
8131-117016-0050	 ever see a Martian election.
8131-117016-0051	 No, you're a firster. He can't lose.
8131-117016-0052	 and then hell is going to pop and this whole planet may be blown wide open.
8131-117016-0053	 It fitted with a dire predictions of security, and with a spying Gordon was going to do according to them.
8131-117016-0054	 He was getting even fatter now that he was eating better food from the fair restaurant around the corner.
8131-117016-0055	 cost of more, but they'd be respectable.
8131-117016-0056	 Because Izzy is always honest, according to how he sees it.
8131-117016-0057	 But you got earth ideas of the stuff, like I had once.
8131-117016-0058	 The groups grew more experienced and Murdoch was training a new squad every night.
8131-117016-0059	 It wasn't exactly legal, but nothing was here.
8131-117016-0060	 This could lead to abuses as he had seen on earth.
8131-117016-0061	 but there probably wouldn't be time for it if Mayor Wayne was reelected.
8131-117017-0000	 It was night outside, and the phosphor bulbs at the corner glow dimly, giving him barely enough light by which to locate the way to the extemporized precinct house.
8131-117017-0001	 It had probably been years since any had dared risk get after the sun went down.
8131-117017-0002	 and the slow doubtful respect on the faces of the citizens as they nodded to him was even more proof that Haley's system was working.
8131-117017-0003	 Gordon hit the signal switch and the Mars speaker let out a shrill whistle.
8131-117017-0004	 Guns suddenly seem to be flourishing everywhere.
8131-117017-0005	 You can't do it to me.
8131-117017-0006	 I'm reformed. I'm going straight.
8131-117017-0007	 You damned cops can't. O'Neil was blubbering.
8131-117017-0008	 One look was enough. The workpapers had the telltale over thickening of the signature they had showed up on other papers. Obviously forgeries.
8131-117017-0009	 Some turned away as Gordon and the other cop went to work, but most of them weren't squeamish.
8131-117017-0010	 When it was over, the two picked up their whimpering captive.
8131-117017-0011	 Jenkins, the other cop, had been holding the wallet.
8131-117017-0012	 Must have been making a big contact in something 50-50?
8131-117017-0013	 There must have been over 2,000 credits in the wallet.
8131-117017-0014	 When Gordon and Jenkins came back, Murdoch tossed the money to them, split it.
8131-117017-0015	 Whatever comes to hand, Governor.
8131-117017-0016	 Like this social call, Gordon asked him.
8131-117017-0017	 The little man shook his head, his ancient 18-year-old face turning sober. Nope.
8131-117017-0018	 You owe me some bills, Governor.
8131-117017-0019	 1150 credits.
8131-117017-0020	 You didn't pay up your pledge to the Captain Fund, so I had a fill in.
8131-117017-0021	 A thousand interest at 10% a week, standard right?
8131-117017-0022	 Gordon had heard of the friendly interest charge on the side here, but he shook his head. Wrong, is he?
8131-117017-0023	 Ha is he turned it over and shook his head.
8131-117017-0024	 Now show me where I signed any agreement saying I'd pay you back.
8131-117017-0025	 For a second Izzy's face went blank. Then he chuckled.
8131-117017-0026	 He pulled out the bills and handed them over.
8131-117017-0027	 Thanks, Izzy. Thanks yourself.
8131-117017-0028	 The kid pocketed the money cheerfully nodding.
8131-117017-0029	 The little guy knew Mars as few others did, apparently, from all sides.
8131-117017-0030	 And if any of the other cops had private rackets of their own, Izzy was undoubtedly the man to find it out and use the information. With a beat such as that, even going halves, and with all the grafts at the upper brackets, he'd still be able to make his pile in a matter of months.
8131-117017-0031	 The captain looked completely beaten as he came into the room and dropped onto the bench.
8131-117017-0032	 Go on, accept, damn it.
8131-117029-0000	 There was a man coming from Earth on a second ship who would see him.
8131-117029-0001	 The little publisher was back at the crusader again.
8131-117029-0002	 only Gordon and Sheila were left.
8131-117029-0003	 Credit had been established again and the businesses were open.
8131-117029-0004	 Gordon came to a row of temporary bubbles. Individual dwellings built like the dome, but opaque for privacy.
8131-117029-0005	 They had been lucky.
8131-117029-0006	 Schullberg's volunteers were official now.
8131-117029-0007	 Fats place was still open, though the crooked tables had been removed. Gordon dropped to a stool slipping off his helmet.
8131-117029-0008	 He reached automatically for the glass of ether-needled beer.
8131-117029-0009	 thought you'd be in the chips.
8131-117029-0010	 That's Mars Gordon Echo, the others comment. Why don't you pull off the planet Fats? You could go back to Earth I'd guess. The other not, it'd be.
8131-117029-0011	 Guess a man gets used to anything. Hell, maybe I can hire some bumps to sit around and woup it up when the ship's come in, and bill this as a real old Martian den of sin.
8131-117029-0012	 There was a grin on the other space.
8131-117029-0013	 Finally got our orders for you. It's Mercury.
8131-117029-0014	 We sent 20 others the same way and they failed.
8131-117029-0015	 Let's say you've shifted some of the misery around a bit and given them a chance to do better.
8131-117029-0016	 You can't stay here.
8131-117029-0017	 There's a rocket waiting to transport you to the moon on the way to Mercury right now. Gordon's side.
8131-117029-0018	 And I paid her the pay we owe you from the time you began using your badge. She's out shopping.
8131-117029-0019	 But his old eyes were glinting.
8131-117029-0020	 Did you think we'd let you go without singing you off, cover he asked?
8131-117029-0021	 I, I, oh, dread it, I'm getting old, is he? You tell him.
8131-117029-0022	 He grabbed Gordon's hand and whaddled down the landing plank. Is he shook his head?
8188-269288-0000	 Any coachister had begun to make brains with Liz Lee.
8188-269288-0001	 Laysley determined to try for honors in English language and literature.
8188-269288-0002	 Her tastes all lay in this direction, her idea being buy and buy to follow her mother's proficient of journalism, for which she already showed considerable aptitude.
8188-269288-0003	 She had no idea of allowing herself to break down.
8188-269288-0004	 What do you mean, reply please, Lee?
8188-269288-0005	 Why? You'll be partying from me, you know.
8188-269288-0006	 I would be the constant worry and plague of your life.
8188-269288-0007	 This is this. If, by any chance you don't leave St.Woods, any, I hope you will allow me to be your room fellow again next term.
8188-269288-0008	 Sit any, a flash of light coming into her eyes and then leaving them.
8188-269288-0009	 But she added abruptly, you speak of something which must not take place.
8188-269288-0010	 I must pardon on us. If I don't, I shall die.
8188-269288-0011	 A few moments later, they came a tap at the door.
8188-269288-0012	 Lisely open the door.
8188-269288-0013	 Chain Harriet stood without.
8188-269288-0014	 These litters have just come for you and any coaches does she sit. And, as I was coming upstairs, I thought I would leave them with you.
8188-269288-0015	 Leslie Dengter, an eagerly grasped little parcel.
8188-269288-0016	 Her eyes shone with pleasure at the anticipation of the delightful time she would have rivelling in the home news. The other letter was directed to Eddie Colchista.
8188-269288-0017	 Here is a little for you, Annie, cried loosely.
8188-269288-0018	 Her face grew suddenly, white as death. What is it there?
8188-269288-0019	 I have been styling or rather I have been thrusting.
8188-269288-0020	 Well, read it in peace, say it laterally. I want to stope you.
8188-269288-0021	 I am truly glad to just come.
8188-269288-0022	 Liesly seated herself with a back to her companion and opened her own letters.
8188-269288-0023	 Don't notice me, replied any.
8188-269288-0024	 I must go into the grounds. The air is stifling.
8188-269288-0025	 But they are just shutting up.
8188-269288-0026	 I shall go. I know a way.
8188-269288-0027	 Just after midnight, she rose with a sigh to prepare for bed.
8188-269288-0028	 She looked around the room.
8188-269288-0029	 Now I remember she got a letter which I've seen very much and went out.
8188-269288-0030	 Leslie went to the window and flung it open. She put her head out and tried to peer into the darkness, but the moon had already set, and she could not see more than a couple of yards in front of her.
8188-269288-0031	 She is a very queer, a retic creature, and that letter, there was bad news in that letter.
8188-269288-0032	 What can she be doing out by herself?
8188-269288-0033	 Thisly lived the room, but she had scarcely gone a dozen places down the corridor before she met any returning.
8188-269288-0034	 And his eyes were very bright. Her cheeks were no longer pale, and there was a brilliant colour on them.
8188-269288-0035	 She did not take the least notice of her plaything, but going into the room shut the door.
8188-269288-0036	 ٨ ٨ ـ ٳ ٦ ٦ ٦ ٦ ٯ ٯ ٦ ٿ ٦ و ٨ ٢ surfaces
8188-269288-0037	 Don't begin. What do you mean?
8188-269288-0038	 I mean that I don't want you to begin to ask questions.
8188-269288-0039	 I walked up and down as fast as ever I could outside in order to make myself sleepy.
8188-269288-0040	 Don't talk to me Leslie. Don't say a single word.
8188-269288-0041	 I shall go off to sleep. That is all I care for.
8188-269288-0042	 Don't see Danny.
8188-269288-0043	 Now, drink this at once. She said in a voice of authority. If you really wish to sleep.
8188-269288-0044	 Annie steered vacantly at the cooker. Then she uttered a laugh.
8188-269288-0045	 Drink that, she said.
8188-269288-0046	 Do you want to kill me? Don't talk anymore.
8188-269288-0047	 I am sleeping. I shall sleep.
8188-269288-0048	 She got into bed as she spoke and wrapped the cloaks tightly round her.
8188-269288-0049	 Cut your manager with a candle just for once.
8188-269288-0050	 See you soon!
8188-269288-0051	 She turned off the light and lit a candle, which she put behind her screen, then prepared to get in the bed.
8188-269288-0052	 And his manner was very mysterious.
8188-269288-0053	 and he did not meet the confinement anyone that night. And the kindest thing was to leave her alone.
8188-269288-0054	 Tie it out, lest you yourself drop the sleep.
8188-269288-0055	 Any? Is that you? She called out.
8188-269288-0056	 There was no reply, but the sound of hurrying steps came quicker and quicker. Now and then they were interrupted by a groan.
8188-269288-0057	 Oh, this will kill me. My heart will break. This will kill me.
8188-269290-0000	 The Guild of St Elizabeth.
8188-269290-0001	 Immediately after dinner that evening, Leslie ran up to her room to make preparations for her visit to East Hall.
8188-269290-0002	 I'm not coming, see you then.
8188-269290-0003	 Every student is to be an East Hall at half-pass state.
8188-269290-0004	 It doesn't matter. Replyed any. Whether it is an order or not. I'm not coming. Say nothing about me please.
8188-269290-0005	 It burned as if with fever.
8188-269290-0006	 You don't know what a trial it is for me to have you here.
8188-269290-0007	 I want to be a lord. Go!
8188-269290-0008	 I know you don't quite mean what you say, said Lisely, but of course, if you really wish me.
8188-269290-0009	 You fret maybe on the endurance.
8188-269290-0010	 Wrapping a pretty blue shawl around hidden shoulders, she turned to Annie.
8188-269290-0011	 Leslie was just closing the door behind her when Annie called out to her.
8188-269290-0012	 I took it out, see it please. Took it out!
8188-269290-0013	 Have the contest to find and put it back.
8188-269290-0014	 But don't lock me out, please, Annie.
8188-269290-0015	 Oh, I won't lock you out, she said. But I must have the key.
8188-269290-0016	 Jane here its voice was heard in the passage.
8188-269290-0017	 As she walks down the corridor, she heard it being turned to the lock.
8188-269290-0018	 What can this mean? She said to herself.
8188-269290-0019	 Oh, I won't press you, replied Jane.
8188-269290-0020	 Oh, I shall never do that replied Leslie.
8188-269290-0021	 You see, all the girls except I lean in Marjorie laugh at her, and that seems to me to make her worth.
8188-269290-0022	 Some day Jane, you must see her.
8188-269290-0023	 If you were in London during the summer, you must come and pay for the visit. Will you?
8188-269290-0024	 That is, if you care to comply to me.
8188-269290-0025	 I believe poor Annie is dreadfully unhappy.
8188-269290-0026	 That's just a chain. That is what Brighton's be. She refuses to come.
8188-269290-0027	 Refuses to come, she cried.
8188-269290-0028	 She'll get an awful scrape.
8188-269290-0029	 I am sure she is ill. She works too hard and she, but there, I don't know that I ought to say anymore.
8188-269290-0030	 I'll wait for you here. Sit loosely.
8188-269290-0031	 Do come any, do!
8188-269290-0032	 She gistly, likely, replied Leslie. She told me she was determined not to come to the meeting.
8188-269290-0033	 But, Marjorie and Idleine had already departed, and Lizlian Jane found themselves among the last students to arrive at the Great East Hall.
8188-269290-0034	 Mr. Lorda Dale was standing with the other tutors and principals of the different halls or raised platform.
8188-269290-0035	 Then a raw coal was gone through by one of the tutors. The only absentee was any coal chister.
8188-269290-0036	 The physical part of the ur-training and also the mental part are abundantly supplied in this great house of learning she continued. But the spiritual part, it seems to me, ought now to be strengthened.
8188-269290-0037	 Hair hair and once again hair.
8188-269290-0038	 She uttered a stream of mark standing up.
8188-269290-0039	 Marjorie and Eileen were close to her.
8188-269290-0040	 I will talk with you, Bell Archeson, presently, she said.
8188-269290-0041	 The names of the proposed members are to be submitted to me before this day week.
8188-269290-0042	 Am I my brother's keeper?
8188-269290-0043	 You ask? She continued.
8188-269290-0044	 God assist each of you. You are.
8188-269290-0045	 The world says, no, I am not, but God says, yes you are.
8188-269290-0046	 All men are your brothers.
8188-269290-0047	 For all who sin, all who suffer, you are to exert an extent responsible.
8188-269290-0048	 After the address, the girls themselves were encouraged to speak and a very animated discussion followed.
8188-269290-0049	 It was past ten o'clock when she left the hall.
8188-269290-0050	 just as she was doing so, with Freya came up.
8188-269290-0051	 Any call chest is your room fellow, is she not? She said.
8188-269290-0052	 I see by your face, Miss Gilles Roy, that you were distressed about something. Are you keeping anything back?
8188-269290-0053	 I'm afraid I am replied LSD, distressed now in her tone.
8188-269290-0054	 I must see her myself early in the morning, and I am quite sure that nothing will satisfy Miss Lodajel except a very ample apology and a full explanation of the reason why she
8188-269290-0055	 Excuases make no difference.
8188-269290-0056	 The girl who breaks the rules has to be punished.
8188-269290-0057	 I will tell her.
8188-274364-0000	 The comments also voted that the new created peers ought to have no voice in this trial, because the accusation being agreed to while there were commoners, their consent to it was implied with that of all the comments of England.
8188-274364-0001	 In the government of Ireland, his administration had been equally promoted of his masters and the trust, and that of the subjects committed to his care.
8188-274364-0002	 The case of Lord Montnoros of all those which were collected with so act industry is the most flagrant and the least excusable.
8188-274364-0003	 The court, which consisted of the chief officials of the army, found the crime to be capital and condemned that nobleman to lose his head.
8188-274364-0004	 with a token boat gesture to discover it.
8188-274364-0005	 It is now a full 240 years since treason were defined, and so long has it been since any man was touched to the sixth date upon this crime before myself.
8188-274364-0006	 Let us not to her own destruction, awake those sleeping lions by rattling up a company of old records which have lain for so many ages by the wall, forgotten and neglected.
8188-274364-0007	 However, these gentlemen at the bar say they speak for the Cornwealth and they believe so. Yet, under favour, it is I who, in this particular, speak for the Cornwealth.
8188-274364-0008	 My Lords, I have now travelled your Lordships a great deal longer than I should have done.
8188-274364-0009	 Young vein, falling upon this paper of notes, deemed the matter of the utmost importance and immediately communicated it to Pym, who now produced the paper before the House of Cummins.
8188-274364-0010	 The king proposes this difficulty. But how can I undertake a fencing war if I have no more money?
8188-274364-0011	 You're managed to see having tried the affixions of your people, you're absolved and loose from all rules of government, and may do what power will admit.
8280-266249-0000	 Old Mr. Dinsmore had accepted a pressing invitation from his granddaughter and her husband to join the party, and with the addition of servants it was a large one.
8280-266249-0001	 As they were in no haste, and the confinement of a railroad car would be very irksome to the younger children. It had been decided to make the journey by water.
8280-266249-0002	 There were no sad leaf-takes to mar their pleasure. The children were in wild spirits, and all seemed cheerful and happy as they sat or stood upon the deck, watching the receding shore as the vessel steamed out of the harbor.
8280-266249-0003	 At links, the land had quite disappeared. Nothing could be seen but the sky overhead and a vast expanse of water all around, and the passengers found leisure to turn their attention upon each other.
8280-266249-0004	 There are some nice looking people on board, remarked Mr. Traveller and an undertone to his wife.
8280-266249-0005	 Besides ourselves, I had a cousin Ronald laughing.
8280-266249-0006	 Yes, she answered. That little group yonder. A young minister and his wife and child, I suppose.
8280-266249-0007	 and when it gives it a fellow he is, just about the age of our herald I should judge.
8280-266249-0008	 Do you, son, was a smiling rejoinder?
8280-266249-0009	 He certainly looks like a very nice little boy.
8280-266249-0010	 Suppose you and he shake hands Frank.
8280-266249-0011	 I do indeed. The probably competitively few are aware that tobacco is the cause of their ailments.
8280-266249-0012	 That list out is the case. We marked Mr. Dintomar.
8280-266249-0013	 With all my heart, if you will step into the gentleman's cabin where there's a light.
8280-266249-0014	 He led the way, the others all following, and taking out a slip of paper read from it in a distinct tone. Lot enough to be heard by those all about him, without disturbing the other passengers.
8280-266249-0015	 One drop of nicotine, extracted tobacco, placed on the tongue of the dog, will kill him in a minute. The hundredth part of a grain, prepped under the skin of a man's arm, will produce nausea and fainting.
8280-266249-0016	 The half dozen cigars which most smokers use a day contain six or seven grains Enough if concentrated and absorbed to kill three men and a pounder tobacco according to its quality contains from one quarter to one and a quarter ounces
8280-266249-0017	 Is it strange then that smokers and chewers have a thousand ailments?
8280-266249-0018	 that the French Polytechnic Institute had to prohibit its use on account of its effects upon the mind.
8280-266249-0019	 Notice the multitude of sudden deaths and see how many are smokers and chewers.
8280-266249-0020	 In a small country town, seven of these mysterious providences occurred within the circuit of a mile, all directly traceable to tobacco, and any physician on a few moments' reflection can match this fact by his own observation.
8280-266249-0021	 And then such powerful acids produce intense irritation and thirst. Thirst which water does not quench.
8280-266249-0022	 Hence a resort to cider and beer.
8280-266249-0023	 No, sir. What? No, you not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost, which is in you, which you have of God, and you are not your own.
8280-266249-0024	 for you are bought with a price. Therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God's.
8280-266249-0025	 We certainly have no right to injure our bodies either by neglect or self-indulgence.
8280-266249-0026	 And again, I beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God that he presents your bodies a living sacrifice, holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service.
8280-266249-0027	 It must require a good deal of resolution for one who has become fond of the indulgence to give it up. Remark to Mr. Daily.
8280-266249-0028	 No doubt, no doubt, return Mr. Lilburn, but if I write to I offend the pluck it out and cast it from me, for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.
8280-266249-0029	 There was a pause, broken by young horse, who had been watching a group of men gathered about a table at the further end of the room.
8280-266249-0030	 They're gambling, yonder, and I'm afraid that young fellow is being badly fleeced by the middle-aged man opposite.
8280-266249-0031	 The eyes of the whole party where it once turned in that direction.
8280-266249-0032	 No sir, he is not here.
8280-266249-0033	 And the door was slammed violently too.
8280-266249-0034	 Now the voice came from the skylight overhead, apparently, and with a fierce implication, the eye-rake games deranged upon deck and ran hither and that there, and searched for his tormentor.
8280-266249-0035	 His victim, who had been looking on during the little scene, and listening to the mysterious voice in silent, wide-eyed wonder and fear, now rose hastily, his face deathly pale, with trembling hands gathered at the money he had stayed, and herring to his state room locked himself in.
8280-266249-0036	 What does it mean, cried one?
8280-266249-0037	 A ventrilla quest of bored, of course, returned another. Let's follow and see the fun.
8280-266249-0038	 I wonder which of us it is remarked the first looking hard at our party. I don't know, but come on!
8280-266249-0039	 That fellow Nick Ward, as noted, Black Lag and Ruffian, had his nose broken in a fight and as sensitive on the subject. Was cheating, of course.
8280-266249-0040	 Who? Ask the mate? I've seen no napir, though there are some in the stearage.
8280-266249-0041	 They heard him in silence, with a cool, flugmatic indifference most exasperating to one in his present mood.
8280-266249-0042	 A man of giant size at Herkulean strength had laid aside his pride and slowly rising to his feet, seized the scoundrel in his powerful grasp.
8280-266249-0043	 Let me go, Y'all the Ward, making a desperate effort to free his arms.
8280-266249-0044	 I think no. I think I did you from lesson! Return to his chapter. Not relaxing his grasp in the least.
8280-266249-0045	 The German released his prisoner, and the latter sunk away with muttered threats and implications upon the head of his tremendous.
8280-266249-0046	 Mr. Lilburn and Mr. Daily, each at a different time, sought out young man, words intended victim, and tried to influence him for good.
8280-266249-0047	 Yet there was gambling again the second night between Ward and several others of his profession.
8280-266249-0048	 They kept it up till after midnight.
8280-266249-0049	 Then Mr. Lillberg, waking from his first sleep in a state room nearby, thought he would break it up once more.
8280-266249-0050	 And intense voiceless excitement possessed the players for the game was a close one. And the stakes were very heavy.
8280-266249-0051	 They've been eagerly over the board, each watching with feverish anxiety his companion's movements. Each casting, now and again, a gloting eye upon the heap of golden greenbacks that lay between them, and at times, half stretching out his hand to clutch it.
8280-266249-0052	 A deep groan startled them, and they spring to their feet, pale and trembling with sudden terror, each holding his breath, and straining his ear to catch a repetition of the dread sound.
8280-266249-0053	 But always silent, and after a moment of anxious waiting, they sat down to their game again, trying to conceal and shake off their fears to the forced and natural laugh.
8280-266249-0054	 It came from under the table, gas toward. Look what's there. Look yourself.
8280-266249-0055	 What can it have been? They asked each other.
8280-266249-0056	 Oh, nonsense, but fools we are.
8280-266249-0057	 It was the last game of cards for that trip.
8280-266249-0058	 The captain came in shortly after the sudden flight of the gamblers, took charge of the money, and the next day restored it to the owners.
8280-266249-0059	 To else he's observant eyes, it presently became evident that the dailies were in very straightened circumstances.
8280-266249-0060	 Oh, how kind, how very kind!" Mrs. Daily said, the tears of joy and gratitude. We have hardly known how we should meet the most necessary expenses of this trip, but have been trying to cast our care upon the Lord, asking Him to provide.
8280-266249-0061	 And how wonderfully he has answered our petitions.
8280-266249-0062	 LC answered, pressing her hand affectionately. Are we not sisters in Christ?
8280-266249-0063	 year all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.
8280-266249-0064	 You are all one in Christ Jesus.
8280-266249-0065	 We feel my husband and I that we are only the stewards of his bounty, and because he has said, in as much as he have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, you have done it unto me, it is the greatest privilege and delight to do anything for his people.
8461-258277-0000	 When it was the 700 and 18th night
8461-258277-0001	 But he answered, needs my style have Zainab also. Now certainly they came a wrap at the door, and the maid said, who is at the door?
8461-258277-0002	 The knocker replied, Come on, daughter of Azharaya the Jew, say me, Isali of Cairo with you.
8461-258277-0003	 Reply the broker's daughter or thou daughter of a dog.
8461-258277-0004	 And having thus Islamised, she asked him, two men in the faith of Al Islam give marriage portions to women or to women to our men.
8461-258277-0005	 and she threw down the juice head before him.
8461-258277-0006	 Now the cause of her slaying her sire was as follows.
8461-258277-0007	 then he set out rejoicing to return to the barricade of the 40.
8461-258277-0008	 So he ate and fell down senseless, for the sweet meats were drug with bang, were upon the casie bundled him into the sack and made off with him, charger and chest and all, to the barricade of forty.
8461-258277-0009	 Presently Hassan Shuman came out of a closet and said to him, how still God and the gear, O Ali?
8461-258277-0010	 So he told him what had been falling him and added, if I know whether the rascal is gone and where to find the nave, I would pay him out.
8461-258277-0011	 No, it's not wither he went.
8461-258277-0012	 Answered Hassan, I know where he is, an open in the door of the closet showed him the sweet midseller within, drugged and senseless.
8461-258277-0013	 So I went round about the highways of the city till I met a sweet meat seller and buying his clothes and stocking trade and gear for ten dinars did what was done.
8461-258277-0014	 Quotha Rashid, whose head is this?
8461-258277-0015	 So I later related to him all that that passed from first last, and the caliph said, I had not thought that thou would skill him, for that he was a source around.
8461-258277-0016	 He replied, I have 40 lads, but they are in Cairo.
8461-278226-0000	 and Laura had her own pet plans.
8461-278226-0001	 She meant to be scrupulously conscientious in the administration of a talent, and sometimes at church on a Sunday, when the sermon was particularly awakening, she meant to debate the serious question as to where the new bonnets and a pair of Zhuvans' gloves daily were not sinful. But I think she decided that the new bonnets and gloves were, on the whole, a part on a bonnable weakness as being good for trade.
8461-278226-0002	 One morning Laura told her husband, with a gay laugh, that she was going to victimise him, but he was to promise to be patient and bear with her for once in a way.
8461-278226-0003	 I want to see all the pictures, the modern pictures especially.
8461-278226-0004	 I remember all the rubens says at the Louvre, for I saw them three years ago when I was staying in Paris with Grandpa Pa.
8461-278226-0005	 She returned in a little more than 10 minutes in the freshest toilet, all pale shimmering blue like the spring sky, with percray gloves and boots and parasol and a bonnet that seemed made of azure butterflies.
8461-278226-0006	 He was drawing towards the close of this delightful honeymoon tour. And it was a bright sunshine in morning, early in February, but February in Paris is sometimes better than April in London.
8461-278226-0007	 But she fixed upon a picture, which she set she preferred to anything she had seen in the gallery.
8461-278226-0008	 Philip Jocelyn was examining some pictures on the other side of the room when his wife made this discovery.
8461-278226-0009	 How I wish it could get me a copy of that picture Philip, Laura said and treating me.
8461-278226-0010	 I should so like one to hang in my morning room at Jocelyn's Rock.
8461-278226-0011	 She turned to the French aunt, this presently, and asked them where the elder Mr. Curstle left, and if there was any possibility of seeing him.
8461-278226-0012	 They have said that he is even a little inbecil, that he does not remember himself of the most common events of his life.
8461-278226-0013	 But there are some others who say that his memory has not all together failed, and that he is still enough harshly critical towards the works of others.
8461-278226-0014	 I don't think you will have any difficulty in finding the house.
8461-278226-0015	 You will be doing me such a favour, fella, but you'll say yes.
8461-281231-0000	 He's followers rush forward to Ahele, and their united force compelling the Black Knight to pause. They track the wounded leader within the walls.
8461-281231-0001	 It was on their journey to that town that they were overtaken on the road by Cedric and his party. In whose company there were afterwards carried captive to the castle of Torkelstown.
8461-281231-0002	 As he lay upon his bed, wrapped with pain and mental agony and filled with fear of rapidly approaching death, he heard a voice addressing.
8461-281231-0003	 What art thou, he exclaimed in terror?
8461-281231-0004	 Leave me and seek the sacks in which Ulrica who was my temptress, let her as well as I taste the tortures which anticipate hell.
8461-281231-0005	 exclaim the nomen. Ho!
8461-281231-0006	 Remember as though the magazine of fuel that is stolen is these apartments? Woman!
8461-281231-0007	 They are fast-tricing, at least," said Eureka, and a signal shall soon wave toward the besieges to press hard upon those who would extinguish them.
8461-281231-0008	 Meanwhile, the Black Knight had led his forces again to the attack, and so vigorous was their assault, that before London the gate of the castle alone separated them from those within.
8461-281231-0009	 The defenders, finding the castle to be on fire, now determined to sell their lives as dearly as they could. And headed by the Bracey, they threw up in the gate, and were at once involved in a terrific conflict with those outside.
8461-281231-0010	 The Black Knight, with potent or strength, forces way inward in despite of the bracy and his followers.
8461-281231-0011	 Two of the foremost instantly fell, and the rest gave way, notwithstanding all the leaders' efforts to stop them.
8461-281231-0012	 The black knight was soon engaged in desperate combat with the Norman Chief, and the vaulted roof of the hall wrung with a furious blows.
8461-281231-0013	 at length to bracy fell.
8461-281231-0014	 Tell me thy name, or work thy pleasure on me.
8461-281231-0015	 Yet first let me say," said the Bracey. What it imports thee to know.
8461-281231-0016	 exclaim the black knight, prisoner and parish!
8461-281231-0017	 The life of every man in the castle shall answer it if a hair of his head be singed. Show me his chamber.
8461-281231-0018	 Raising the wounded man with ease, the black knight rushed with him to the past and gate, and having their deliver his burden to the care of two yew men, he again entered the castle to assist in the rescue of their prisoners.
8461-281231-0019	 But in other parts, the besiegers pursued the defenders of the castle from chamber to chamber and satiated in the blood, the vengeance which had long animated them against the soldiers of the tyrant from the booth.
8461-281231-0020	 As the fire commends to spread rapidly through all parts of the castle, Ulrika appeared on one of the turrets.
8461-281231-0021	 Before long the towering flames had surmounted every obstruction and rose through the evening skies when huge and burning beacon seen far and wide through the adjacent country. Towered after tower crashed down with blazing roof and rafter.
8461-281231-0022	 At length, with a terrific crash, the whole turret gave way, and she perished in flames, which had consumed her tyrant.
8461-281231-0023	 When the outlaws had divided the spoils which they had taken from the castle of Tockelstone, Cedric prepared to take his departure.
8461-281231-0024	 He left the gallant band of foresters, sorrowing deeply for his lost friend, the lord of Koningsburg, and he and his followers at scarce departed, when a procession moved slowly from under the greenwood branches in the direction which he had taken, in the centre of which was the car in which the body of Adelstein was laid.
8461-281231-0025	 to brace him belt low and in silence through himself upon a horse and galloped off through the woods.
8461-281231-0026	 Here is a bugle which an English yo-man has once worn. I pray you to keep it as a memorial of your gallant bearing.
8461-281231-0027	 So saying, he mounted a strong warhorse and rode off through the forest.
8461-281231-0028	 During all this time Isaac of York sat mournfully apart, grieving for the loss of his daily love daughter Rebecca.
8461-281231-0029	 And with this a pestle, then happy old man set out to procure his daughter's liberation.
8461-281231-0030	 The Templar is flared," said the Bracey, in answer to the Prince's eager questions. From the birth you will never see more, and he added in a low and emphatic tone, Richard is an England, I have seen him and spoken with him.
8461-281231-0031	 He appealed to the brassy to assist him in his project and became at once deeply suspicious of the night's loyalty towards him when he declined to left hand against the man who had spared his own life.
8461-281231-0032	 Before reaching his destination he was told that Lucas the Bourmanois, the Grand Master of the Order of the Templars, was then on visit to the Preceptory.
8461-281231-0033	 He had not until then been informed of the presence of the Jewish maiden in the abode of the Templars, and great was his fury and indignation on learning that she was amongst them.
8461-281231-0034	 Por Isaac was hurried off accordingly and expelled from the perceptory, all his entreaties, and even his office unheard and disregarded.
8461-281231-0035	 The assurance that she possess some friend and his awful assembly gave a courage to look around and to mark into whose presence she had been conducted.
8461-281231-0036	 She gaze the cordingly upon a scene which might well have struck terror into a bolder heart than who's.
8461-281231-0037	 At his feet was placed the table occupied by two scribes whose duty was to record the proceedings of the day.
8461-281231-0038	 The preceptors of whom there were four present occupied seats behind the superiors and behind them stood the squires of the order, roped in white.
